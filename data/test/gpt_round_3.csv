0,emotional reasoning,"A Roomate of mine stole my comptuer And I think Someone I trusted stole something valuable of mine, I was extremely angry and wanted justice","Although I initially felt angry and betrayed when I discovered my computer was stolen, I could consider a variety of other perspectives. Maybe my roommate borrowed it without asking because they urgently needed it for a task and intended to return it before I knew it was gone. Or perhaps, it wasn't my roommate but another person who came into our home, which could prompt a conversation about security. Instead of jumping to conclusions and feeling rage, I could calmly discuss this with my roommate to understand their side of the story. If the theft is confirmed, instead of seeking vengeance, I might opt for reporting the theft and looking at possible dispute resolution options."
1,overgeneralizing,"A few days ago, I got angry at my husband's grandmother who lives next door for beeping her horn till I came out of the house and asking me to come to dinner. And I think She doesn't respect me.","Perhaps her grandmother-in-law is not intentionally trying to disrespect me, but this is her unique way of communicating that dinner is ready. She might be from a generation or culture where honking is a common form of communication. Even when this is unusual for me, it does not necessarily mean an act of disrespect. It could also represent her enthusiasm to share a meal with me, which could indicate closeness or a sense of family. I could talk kindly yet honestly to her about how this affects me and mutually find better ways of getting the same message across. It's also important to understand her feelings or intentions before jumping into conclusions."
2,disqualifying the positive,A friend who is a recent widower has started dating. And I think My friend is ignoring his recently-deceased wife.,"My friend, the recent widower, has begun dating which might seem surprising. However, instead of seeing this as an act of disrespect or disregard for his late wife, it could be his way of coping with his grief and loneliness. He may feel the need to fill the void left by his wife's passing or to keep himself occupied to help manage his sorrow. His actions indicate his attempts to move forward, which does not necessarily mean he forgets or loves his late wife any less. Perhaps this is his way of embracing life again while dealing with the pain."
3,"labeling,catastrophizing",A neighbor borrowed my smartphone charger and never returned it. And I think he took me for granted!,"Maybe my neighbor genuinely forgot to return my charger, or perhaps they are still using it because their charger broke. It's also possible that they intended to return it but got distracted. Alternatively, they might not realize that I need the charger back. I could also consider that they may feel uncomfortable or awkward about returning it for some reason."
4,catastrophizing,"A new policy at work was established and required cooperation of efforts from another department in order to meet the new requirements. I took initiative and set meetings to talk about the new roles. After the meeting a verbal agreements were made I drafted a memorandum of agreement outlining the verbal agreements. A day later, the other department refused to participate because they did not want to do any extra work. And I think We will not be able to complete the work that needs to be done","Although the other department initially refused to cooperate, it doesn't mean that we cannot complete the work that needs to be done. There might be a chance that they may have misunderstood the content of the agreement or the benefits towards them. I could initiate another meeting and bring in a neutral third party to mediate and facilitate the conversation, providing clarifications where needed. There is also a possibility of seeking assistance from a higher authority to enforce the inter-department cooperation. Alternatively, we could explore the opportunity of restructuring our tasks and exploring other solutions to meet the new policy's requirements without relying heavily on the other department's assistance."
5,personalizing,A potential client decided to work with another company And I think I failed our company & myself,"The client choosing to work with another company doesn't necessarily reflect on my personal capabilities or the value of our company. It could be due to various factors like budget, more alignment with the other company's ideas, or personal relations. I can use this situation as an opportunity to learn and grow, by soliciting feedback or by reflecting on the discussions that we had. This will improve our future pitches, and I can take this ""failure"" as a stepping stone towards success. In the end, it's not every time that outcomes of situations will be as per my desire, and that's okay, it's not a personal failure."
6,"all-or-nothing thinking,personalizing",A student let me know they are struggling to grasp any of the concepts in class. And I think Am I not explaining the material well?,"Alternatively, it could be that the student has personal issues that are preventing them from focusing effectively, they may have a learning disability, or the student could be experiencing difficulties absorbing this particular style or method of teaching. It could also be due to any gaps in previous knowledge which are preventing the understanding of new material or maybe the pace of class is too fast for them. I should consider checking in with the student to better understand their unique situation, rather than defaulting to self-blame."
7,"fortune telling,all-or-nothing thinking,emotional reasoning,catastrophizing",A week ago me and my GF were trying to find a store in a nearby town but we got lost. And I think We won't be able to find the store before it closes.,"While initially, it might indeed seem like we won't be able to find the store before it closes, there are other possibilities we can consider. We could have asked for directions from locals in the town, which could speed up our search. If we had access to a smartphone, we could have used GPS or map applications to plan and direct us. Perhaps the store had a contact number, we could have called them to ask for directions or even to inform them that we're on our way and ask if they could stay open a little longer. We might also discover another store in the process of searching that has the same item we're looking for. Even if we don't get to the store in time, we could turn it into a fun exploratory adventure, making the most of our trip to the nearby town. Let's not forget that we can always come back another day to find the store when it's open."
8,overgeneralizing,"After I complained about not spending time together, my boyfriend did not want to go on a date last weekend. And I think He doesn't love me.","Perhaps my boyfriend didn't want to go out last weekend because he was dealing with some personal issues or he might have been tired from work. It might not have anything to do with his love for me. Maybe he just needed some time to rest and recharge. Also, maybe we have different ideas of spending time together. It's important for me to communicate my needs and feelings to him clearer and vice versa. In addition, it would also be useful to think about the other ways he shows his love, not strictly through going on dates. It is possible that he is expressing his feelings in ways I haven't recognized yet, like supporting me in my career or caring for me when I'm unwell."
9,emotional reasoning,All of my relationship attempts have ended in failure And I think Suicidal thoughts,"Although my past relationships have been challenging, not every future relationship is bound to fail. It's possible that I may have been hitting a rough patch or not finding the right match yet. It doesn't mean I am destined for broken relationships. Having suicidal thoughts, on the other hand, is immensely serious and it's not a solution to my relationship issues. I should reach out to mental health professionals to help manage these thoughts while focusing on self-improvement and personal growth. In the future, I may find someone compatible who understands and supports me. Trying different approaches in relationships could also lead to better outcomes. Hence, it's essential to remain hopeful and seek help when needed."
10,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling,overgeneralizing,fortune telling,personalizing",An mturk requester rejected my task and I wasn't sure why because I work very hard on my tasks. Being new it affected my approval rating more negatively. And I think I'm not smart enough to succeed at mturk,"While it's disheartening to have a task rejected, especially as a beginner, it may not entirely be an indicator of my abilities or intelligence. It's possible the requester might have made a mistake or had specific criteria I wasn't aware of. This single rejection doesn't necessarily reflect on my future success on mturk. It's crucial to remember this as I continue to gain experience and hone my skills. It's a learning process and does not define my self-worth or capacities. It should motivate me for improvement and clearer understanding of instructions. Everybody faces rejection at some point, but it's the ability to bounce back that matters."
11,"mind reading,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,labeling,personalizing","At dinner my mother in law kept trying to tell me how to watch my daughter and was being condensending, I finally got angry and told her to mind her own business. And I think My mother in law thinks I am an incompetent father.","Maybe my mother-in-law is not questioning my parenting abilities but is only trying to offer her advice based on her experience. It's possible that her intention was to help, but the way she conveyed her thoughts may have come off as condescending. I might have misinterpreted her intentions due to my own feelings of insecurity or pressure about being a good father. Perhaps, it’s not that she thinks I am incompetent, but she might be concerned about her grandchild especially given the generation gap. Next time, I could try to view her suggestions as just that - suggestions, not judgments of my parenting skills. I can also communicate my feelings to her to clarify the misunderstanding."
12,"labeling,emotional reasoning",At work I was frustrated after a meeting because I was told a certain amount of documents had to be indexed that week. I had a lot of other tasks and I started frantically naming them off. I was not expected to be indexing the full collection of documents like I thought I was so I was later embarassed I had acted so frustrated and snappy. And I think I thought I was being taken advantage of.,"At work, I experienced frustration during a meeting due to an unexpected task given to me, which was indexing a certain amount of documents within a week. On top of my existing workload, this seemed overwhelming and I reactively listed out my tasks, somewhat snapping in the process. Later, I realized that I misunderstood the scope of the task - I was not expected to index the entire collection. This resulted in embarrassment for my previous reaction, making me believe that I had been taken advantage of. Alternatively, it could be that the person assigning me the task didn't clearly describe its scope, leading to this confusion. Perhaps I was feeling extra sensitive due to the previous workload and I let my emotions get the best of me. It might be valuable for me to develop better communication with my bosses or seek clarification before reacting immediately in future."
13,negative feeling or emotion,Becoming broke again. And I think I can't and never will escape this prison at my moms house,"While it's currently challenging living at my mom's house, it might not be permanent. There could be opportunities to improve my financial state that I haven't considered or explored yet. Maybe there are jobs or sidelines to which I can apply despite my current limitations. It is also possible that I could find alternative living arrangements that I can afford. I can use this period as a chance to learn financial management and how to live independently. There may be resources out there like counselling services, nonprofits, or government programs that could assist me. It's difficult now, but I can take this as a learning experience to uplift the situation and plan my future better. I should remind myself that it's okay to feel stuck but not every moment defines my future."
14,labeling,Being transgender And I think I'm not who I want to be. I hate my appearance and my voice.,"While dealing with the dissatisfaction about my physical appearance and voice as a part of my transgender identity is a valid concern, it's also important to consider other facets of my identity. These include acknowledging the bravery it took for me to embrace my true self, the progress I have made so far in my transition journey, and the individual growth it continues to stimulate in me. I should also factor in the supportive community of people, whether online or offline, that I can turn to for guidance and reassurance. There's room for learning to appreciate the unique journey I'm on and how it shapes my character, rather than focusing solely on the external aspects."
15,emotional reasoning,Breakup after loving truly. And I think I am scared of my future life and being in sorrow of breakup and didn't feel light of overthinking,"While I am feeling scared and lost after my recent breakup, there could be an opportunity to explore new aspects of my life in this free time. I might engage in self-discovery or reconnect with old passions and hobbies that had taken the backseat. I take this time as a chance to strengthen my mental and emotional self. The sadness and overthinking are transient emotions that will fade over time. I'd choose to look at this as a learning period, wherein I am learning how to deal with pain and fostering resilience. It may also be the right time to assess what I need from future relationships or reassess my understanding and expectations of love."
16,fortune telling,"Dealing with PTSD And I think If I don't sleep well one night due to panic attack, then I it will only get worse","Though my PTSD can lead to difficulties with sleep due to panic attacks, I acknowledge that there might be other factors contributing to my poor sleep, like stress, diet, or exercise habits. Tweaking these aspects may also be helpful. Moreover, having one bad night doesn't necessarily mean that every night will follow the same pattern. Additionally, I could explore various therapeutic strategies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, for improving my sleep hygiene, and relaxation techniques to manage anxiety at night. Furthermore, sharing my fears with loved ones or support groups can also help. It's crucial to remember that healing isn't linear, but with the right tools, progress is possible."
17,disqualifying the positive,Don't have a job And I think I'm a failure,"Not having a job right now does not define my worth nor does it mean I am a failure. It is an opportunity for me to reassess my career goals and invest in myself to gain additional skills or knowledge to better prepare myself for the job market. It could also be a chance for me to consider starting my own business or pursuing a passion I have held back. I have overcome challenges before, and this is just another one I need to face, not a testament of my overall capability."
18,labeling,"Every time I think I have another chance at love, I am reminded how insufferable and unlovable I make myself. And I think I am a hard person to love","My past experiences with love have been rocky and left me doubting my worthiness to be loved. However, I understand that everyone has struggles and difficulties that can make love a challenge. Maybe instead of being unlovable, I've just not yet found the right person who complements my quirks and personalities. It's also possible that there are emotional wounds from past relationships that I need to heal before I can fully open up to someone new. And it's important to remember that love isn't solely about romantic relationships; love and acceptance can also come from friends, family, or from within myself. It could be beneficial for me to work on self-love and personal growth to better prepare for future relationships."
19,negative feeling or emotion,Everyone in my life has left me And I think Someone please kill me,"While it's true that I have lost many people in my life, it's also possible that this is a period of change and growth. It's painful right now, but it may lead me to meet new and exciting people in the future. Rather than focusing on the thought of ending my life, I could use my current state of loneliness as motivation to join a support group, reconnect with old friends, or even to seek professional help like therapy, to gain new insights and coping strategies. I need to remember that it's okay to ask for help when dealing with such intense feelings."
20,negative feeling or emotion,Everyone is mean to me And I think I hate everyone,"Maybe not everyone is mean to me, I might be perceiving their actions or words as mean due to my current emotional state. It's possible that some people are actually trying to help or care for me but it's just coming across in a way that feels negative. Plus, it's unlikely I truly hate everyone. It's more likely that I'm feeling overwhelmed by my interactions and need to find healthier ways to communicate or to cope with my feelings. I must remember that it's okay to distance myself from genuinely toxic people, while seeking positive interactions and relationships that benefit my mental health.
"
21,negative feeling or emotion,Fired for not meeting quota as a salesman. And I think I can't pay my bills.,"Getting fired from my previous job as a salesman for not meeting the quota was a setback, but it doesn't mean that I don't have value or skills to succeed elsewhere. I can view this as a chance to explore other opportunities in different fields where I might fit better and where my skills can be put into good use. As for my bills, maybe there are some expenses I can minimize or eliminate for the time being. It's also possible to look for part-time work, freelance, or even seek out financial assistance while I'm looking for a new job. Being unemployed is tough, but it doesn't mean I don't have options or control over the situation. It's a temporary circumstance, not a determinant of my overall worth or potential."
22,fortune telling,First interview after studying and getting my diploma. And I think I'll screw it over,"The first interview could be seen as a stepping stone into my professional career. Yes, there's potential for mistakes since it's my first time, but it's also an opportunity for learning and growth. I have worked hard to earn my diploma, and that preparation will support me. Also, every psychologist started where I am now. Even if it doesn't go perfectly, it's not a definitive statement on my future success as a psychologist. This interview is just a starting point and doesn't determine my entire career. There are many other interviews and opportunities that I will have to prove myself. So instead of focusing on the negative, I should concentrate on the effort I put into preparing for this moment and the experiences that await me in this profession."
23,negative feeling or emotion,"For many years I've been tutoring students online in math and reading. One of my newer students requested to my supervisor that she be assigned to a different tutor because she didn't like me. And I think I was searching my brain to figure out why she didn't like me, and it made me so sad to think I'd hurt her feelings or caused a problem for her.","It's normal to feel upset when encountering such situations, but it's essential not to blame myself right away. Maybe that particular student has a different learning style that I wasn't able to cater to, or perhaps she felt more comfortable with a tutor from her demographic terms like age or gender. It could also be the case that our personalities simply didn't click, which happens. I shouldn't consider this as a failure or personal flaw- All tutors and teachers encounter this situation at some point. Instead, this can be considered an opportunity to self-reflect and evaluate my approach to tutoring. Maybe I can ask for specific feedback from that student or my supervisor to understand what her concerns were and how I can improve in the future."
24,negative feeling or emotion,Go fuck yourself And I think Fuck you,"It's understandable that I might feel frustration, resentment, or even anger sometimes. This could be due to my lingering issues or perhaps the feelings of vulnerability that come with exposing my thoughts and feelings in a therapeutic setting. I might want to express these emotions differently, such as saying, ""I am really struggling and feeling frustrated right now"" or ""I feel like I am not being understood."" It may also be helpful to explore these feelings with my psychologist, to understand where they're coming from and why they're directed at someone who's here to help. This could lead to meaningful insights about myself and my experiences. Remember, it's okay to be angry, but it's important to express it constructively."
25,"fortune telling,catastrophizing,all-or-nothing thinking",Having problems coming up with words to write essay. And I think I will get a bad grade.,"While it's true that I'm currently having trouble coming up with the right words for my essay, this doesn't necessarily mean I'll receive a bad grade. I could consult a classmate, ask my teacher for further clarification or insights, or even seek tutoring. Additionally, I could improve my vocabulary and writing skills through online resources or workshops. Also, it's possible that I'm overestimating the expectations or complexity of the assignment, or I may be being too critical of my own work. The result of the assignment may not be as bad as I'm imagining."
26,blaming,"I actually cannot help it on my own. No matter how hard I try, looking at the bright side of things, logically trying to reason things out, giving myself the benefit of the doubt.. Everything is driving me up the wall. Anger, frustration, sadness, you name it. It's like everything I was able to blow off before is just hitting straight at me and it's relentless. And I think Everything driving me nuts...","While I'm struggling with overwhelming emotions like anger, frustration, and sadness at the moment, it's important to remember that it's okay to seek external help when I need it. Maybe this situation is so difficult that I cannot easily manage it on my own, and that's okay. It's possible that considering professional therapy or counseling as a sign of strength and a step towards recovery, not a sign of weakness. Also, I should consider that these emotions might be temporary and with time, patience, and professional help I may see my situation in a new light. As hard as it is to believe right now, it could be that there is a way out of this and brighter days could potentially be ahead."
27,all-or-nothing thinking,"I always do the wrong thing, I always make mistakes And I think I hate myself","While it is true that I have made mistakes, it does not mean that I always do the wrong thing. Everyone makes mistakes, and it is just part of human nature. Making mistakes does not diminish my value as a person, instead, it offers an opportunity to learn and grow. Sometimes, it is alright not to be perfect. Self-hatred can be fleeting and temporary, it's okay to feel this way, but it's crucial to remember that these feelings are not defining. I have many qualities and strengths that I should focus on. Embracing self-love and self-compassion can motivate me to improve myself and my decisions."
28,negative feeling or emotion,I am alone none understands And I think Can not move have so much to do mind numb,"While it's understandable to feel overwhelmed and isolated, it's essential to remember that these feelings are not definitive facts. For instance, I could start by reaching out to a friend or family member who I trust, to share my feelings and thoughts. This way, I might realize that they understand more than I initially perceived, and it could help me feel less alone. Additionally, even though my workload seems unmanageable, I could try to break down my tasks into smaller, more manageable parts and take things one step at a time, which could make the whole situation seem less intimidating. If my mind feels numb or overloaded, perhaps I could try some mindfulness or relaxation techniques to help clear my head and improve my concentration."
29,emotional reasoning,"I am at a party where I do not know very many people. When I try to talk to a stranger, he gives one word replies and then ignores me. . And I think I am being annoying.","Perhaps the person I tried to engage with at the party is introverted, socially anxious, or simply having a bad day and it's not about me being annoying. Maybe they didn't feel like talking much or they were preoccupied with other thoughts. They could also be overwhelmed by the crowd, noise, or other factors at the party. I might have misinterpreted their one-word replies as disinterest or annoyance, while they might just be their way of communication or they might be struggling to come up with more to say. I could try engaging with other people at the party, maybe someone else would be more open to a conversation."
30,"labeling,negative feeling or emotion,mind reading,personalizing","I am quite fond of a coworker and decide to talk to them. I offer up the idea that it might be fun to go out together sometime, and they respond with the fact they are too busy. And I think I'm not attractive or have a good enough personality.","It's possible that my coworker is genuinely busy and it's not about my attractiveness or personality at all. The coworker may have a lot of ongoing projects and after-work responsibilities or they may not be in the right place for any kind of relationship. They might appreciate the offer and when their schedule clears up, they might reconnect. Alternatively, they could have personal guidelines about maintaining professional boundaries at the office. In any case, this one instance doesn't have to embody my self-worth or attractiveness. I can keep being open and friendly without taking this situation personally."
31,labeling,I am single and isolated And I think im unlovable,"While I may feel isolated and single currently, it's crucial to remember that the state of being alone doesn’t define my worth or lovability. It could be a phase or a situational factor like relocation, losing a partner, or global pandemic etc. Importantly, such states can be a great opportunity to focus on bettering ourselves or to explore interests. Being single offers a certain level of freedom and self-dependence. Additionally, acknowledging and addressing these feelings with a psychologist is already a huge step towards improvement. Remembering there are many others who feel the same, might also help me feel less isolated. Finally, I must remind myself to disassociate my self-worth from my relationship status."
32,all-or-nothing thinking,I am trying to diet but I gained weight this week. And I think I don't have the discipline to diet.,"Maybe gaining weight this week isn't necessarily a failure of my discipline but rather a result of other factors like water retention, muscle gain, or hormonal changes. Perhaps my diet regime is too restrictive and not sustainable for me, and needs to be adjusted. Instead of completely attributing this to my lack of discipline, I should consider other possible reasons, such as not incorporating enough physical activity into my routine or maybe there are some psychological triggers that cause me to overeat which I have not yet addressed. Furthermore, I shouldn't underestimate my capability and strength to follow a diet plan, as discipline may improve over time with consistent effort and practice."
33,"overgeneralizing,all-or-nothing thinking,blaming",I am trying to help my son pay his bills and find a job. And I think He does not appreciate anything I do for him.,"It's important to remember that while I am putting forth efforts to assist my son financially and find employment, he may be struggling with his own internal challenges that prevent him from exhibiting gratitude. His perceived lack of appreciation may stem from personal insecurities, stress, or feelings of inadequacy. Also, my support might be enabling rather than empowering him, which could lead to a strain in our relationship. Perhaps my help would be more constructive if it comes in the form of emotional support, guidance, and encouragement instead of direct financial aid. Additionally, his journey to self-sustainment might require more time and patience."
34,all-or-nothing thinking,I am trying to write up an essay and can't think of anything And I think I'm wasting all my time,"While it feels frustrating that I am unable to write up an essay right now, it's possible that my mind is just tired and needs a break. Maybe some physical activity or a change of environment might stimulate my creativity and thought process. It could also be worthwhile to brainstorm or free write for a few minutes just to get the thoughts flowing. It's essential to remember that just because I'm not making progress at this very moment doesn't mean that the time is wasted. This experience might also be an opportunity to learn how to manage such struggles better in the future."
35,overgeneralizing,I am unable to give my children any time And I think A good mother spends time with her kids on some activity every night,"It's understandable to feel the pressure to conform to idealistic standards of motherhood, but it's also crucial to think about other possibilities. Mothers can show their love and care in different ways. Not being able to spend time with the kids every night doesn't make one a bad mother; it could mean I'm busy providing for them or ensuring they have a secure future. My bond with my children won't suffer due to this. Alternatively, I can touch base with them during the day or early mornings. Quality of time matters more than the quantity. Also, it's important to teach children about independence and self-sufficiency, which they can learn when I'm not around. It's about finding a balance between personal life and parental duties, tailored to our unique situation.
"
36,comparing and despairing,I am under appreciated at work And I think Self worth,"I may feel like I'm under appreciated at work currently, but it's possible that my contributions are unnoticed, not unvalued. It may be helpful to discuss my feelings with my manager or ask for feedback to gain a clear understanding of my performance. Also, I must remember that my self-worth is not determined by my professional successes or failures. It's essential for me to invest in self-care and personal growth activities outside of work, which can help enhance my self-worth and overall satisfaction. It's crucial to relate my self-worth with my qualities as an individual rather than basing it solely on my work performance or appreciation received at work."
37,should statements,I am walking down the street in a new red jeans and a stranger looked at the jeans And I think I should have never worn these jeans and stick to blue ones,"Maybe the stranger looked at my jeans because they admired the color and wish they could pull off wearing red jeans too. Or, perhaps they were simply lost in thought and weren't actually looking at my jeans at all. Moreover, it could be that they are a jeans enthusiast or a stylist and were appreciating the unique style or brand. Most importantly, I should remember that wearing these jeans is my personal choice and I don't need the approval of strangers to feel good about my decisions. Afterall, I wore the jeans because I liked them, not because I wanted to impress others. Reading into the thoughts of others without concrete evidence can lead to unnecessary stress."
38,"labeling,all-or-nothing thinking",I applied for a job and just got a call saying I didn't get the job. And I think I am not good enough for anyone.,"I applied for a job and learned that I didn't get it. Instead of thinking I'm not good enough, I could interpret this situation differently. Perhaps the company found someone who was a better fit for that specific role or had more specific experiences. Also, I might have not presented myself effectively during the interview, and perhaps I can work on my interview skills. Other possibilities could be that my resume needs improvement to highlight my valuable skills better. This situation could give me a chance to reevaluate what I want in my career and refocus my job search. Maybe there's an even better opportunity awaiting for me."
39,"blaming,should statements",I applied for a new part-time position and took the qualifying exam but didn't pass because they  changed some of the guidelines for the job. They warned us beforehand that this may happen in the hiring process. And I think I thought that I should have studied harder. If I knew enough information I would pass no matter how the standards changed. It was my fault I didn't try hard enough and was furious with myself,"While it can be disappointing to not pass the qualifying exam, it's crucial to remember that changes were introduced in the guidelines without much time for preparation. Perhaps my study methods need to be enhanced or diversified to be more adaptable to changes in the future. Also, while there might have been some areas I could have improved on, the responsibility doesn't solely lie on me; the changes in guidelines play a significant role too. Instead of blaming myself entirely, I can use this experience as an opportunity to learn and improve, both on adapting to changes faster and improving my studying strategies. It might not be about how hard I tried, but rather how effectively I prepared."
40,disqualifying the positive,"I applied for a promotion but was told I haven't shown the necessary ambition yet. This happened at work where I always go the extra mile, stay late, and even work when I'm not being paid. I feel like the response to my request for a promotion was inaccurate and that I am being taken advantage of because nothing I could do is enough. I was denied the promotion by the department head who is a woman that seems to always talk down to and be rude to men at the company. And I think I felt as if my talents and efforts were being unrecognized by the company yet they are perfectly happy to accept all of my hard work, just not pay me what I deserve for it.","Perhaps the department head has certain criteria in mind while promoting, which I'm unable to meet currently. It might not be related to being taken advantage of. It could also be that she has a stern demeanor or communication style which I interpret as rudeness. It might be beneficial to have a positive, open conversation with her about the skills or characteristics she believes are necessary for promotion, enabling me to understand better where I stand. Moreover, if I truly feel undervalued and underappreciated, maybe I'm not at the right place and should consider other job opportunities that can rightfully acknowledge my efforts and provide me with deserved growth. While I might be interpreting the situation as gender biased, it may simply be a result of my past experiences or perceptions. It is essential to evaluate these situations objectively, keeping personal biases aside."
41,"catastrophizing,all-or-nothing thinking",I ask out a co-worker who I became fond of recently but was turned down. And I think I won't find someone I can be with,"I have developed feelings for a co-worker and decided to ask them out. Unfortunately, they did not feel the same way and I was turned down. Initially, this made me question if I'll ever be able to find someone I want to be with. However, after reflection, I realize that one rejection does not mean a lifetime of loneliness. I understand that everyone has different tastes and preferences and perhaps we were simply not well-suited for each other. There are countless other opportunities and numerous people out there who I might connect with better. Rather than focusing on the rejection, I now see this as a chance to learn and grow, to improve myself, and move towards establishing a healthy and compatible relationship with someone who appreciates and shares mutual feelings with me."
42,"negative feeling or emotion,emotional reasoning",I ask out a co-worker who I became fond of recently but was turned down. And I think I'm not good enough for her.,"It's possible that she already had a partner, or she isn't interested in dating anyone at the moment. She might be wanting to maintain professional boundaries in the workplace or might not want to mix work and personal life. It might not have anything to do with me, as she might have her own personal reasons which might not reflect on my attractiveness or worth. There is also the possibility that we weren't just a good match or she could not reciprocate the same feelings. Besides, it's one person's opinion and it doesn't determine my self-worth or my capability to have a fulfilling relationship in the future."
43,"personalizing,labeling","I asked my daughter a question, and she responded in a snotty way. And I think She doesn't love me like she used to.","Perhaps my daughter responded in a snotty way because she was having a bad day or was stressed about something unrelated to me. It's not necessarily indicative of her feelings for me, but more about her current state of mind. We all have moments when we react poorly. It doesn't mean she doesn't love me like she used to. It could have simply been an off moment for her. Her love for me can't be measured by a single interaction but should be seen in the context of our overall relationship."
44,labeling,"I asked my husband to get me wine on the way home from work, but he forgot. And I think He is selfish","My husband had a busy day at work and forgot to pick up the bottle of wine I asked for. He usually remembers things I ask him to do, so this may have been a simple oversight and not a reflection of his generally unselfish nature. It's also possible he had a lot on his mind or was preoccupied with something else. I should communicate my feelings to him calmly instead of assuming his forgetfulness is a sign of selfishness."
45,disqualifying the positive,I became very stressed out after getting a bad score on a quiz And I think My grades are important and I did poorly,"While it's true that my grades are important and I did poorly on a quiz, it's critical to remember that a single quiz doesn't define my overall performance. I could consider this as a wakeup call, propelling me to study better for future quizzes. I can learn from this experience by identifying areas where I am weak and focusing on them. It's also possible that I was simply having a bad day, or I didn’t understand the material well. I could approach my teacher or classmates for help. Even though the situation is disappointing, it's also an opportunity for growth and learning."
46,should statements,I burnt the potatoes while cooking And I think I should have been perfect,"Although I burnt the potatoes, it doesn't mean I always have to be perfect at cooking. It could be that I was distracted, the stove was too high, or I left them for too long, among other reasons. Mistakes are part of the learning process and even professional chefs sometimes burn their food. I should give myself some grace, learn from the experience, and try again next time."
47,"fortune telling,catastrophizing,mind reading",I called a woman I love by accident during a bad time And I think She will never love me now,"The call could have also shown her a vulnerable side of me that she appreciates, further strengthening our bond. She may be mature enough to understand that bad times can make people behave unusually. It could be a chance for me to explain and communicate about my issues, making our relationship more open and stronger. Alternatively, she may not have taken the incident too seriously or might have forgotten about it already. This could also stimulate a conversation about timing and awareness of each others’ emotional states, leading to better mutual understanding."
48,"mind reading,fortune telling","I called an old friend, but she wasn't home and didn't return my call. And I think Maybe she doesn't want to talk to me anymore.","There could be many reasons why my old friend didn't return my call. It's possible that she was busy and simply forgot, or she might be going through a difficult time and avoiding contact with people. She could have mislaid my contact, or it's possible she changed her number and I don't have her current contact. Festering over the thought that she may not want to talk to me anymore is jumping to conclusions. I should try reaching out again or give her some time to respond."
49,mind reading,I called my friend three times this past week but she hasn't answered or called/messaged me back yet. And I think Maybe she doesn't really like me as much as I thought and like her. Maybe I'm awkward.,It's possible my friend has been unusually busy this week or she is dealing with her personal issues that she is not ready to discuss just yet. Maybe she missed my calls and forgot to call me back. She could also be facing other challenges that I'm not aware of. It could also be that she does not equate promptness in returning calls with the level of friendship. Perhaps I'm overthinking this situation because of my own insecurities and it has nothing to do with my friend's feelings towards me.
50,catastrophizing,I came home to find my spouse had taken all of his things and left a note saying our marriage was over. And I think My marriage is over.,"Although it's painful to come home to an empty house and a note ending our marriage, it's worth considering other possibilities. It's true that my spouse took his things and left, certainly suggesting an end. However, another possibility could be that my spouse needed some time and space to consider our relationship and the course it should take. It's also possible that my spouse might return to talk through the problems we've been experiencing. Perhaps this is just a breakdown in communication that needs addressing, or maybe there are issues both of us have been avoiding which we now need to face. Lastly, even if the marriage is over, this could present me with an opportunity for self-discovery and growth."
51,labeling,"I can feel everyone becoming distant with me, including my boyfriend. He just cheated on me not even a week ago and i cant bring myself to leave him no matter what he does. He does not care. I have no family, i only ever had him. Im annoying and i am never happy with anything and i hate myself for it because i want to be happy and i want to be a good person. I can feel my heart breaking more and more as i cone to the realization that i am not wanted nor needed. And I think I am a problem.","While it feels like everyone is becoming distant, it may not be the absolute truth. My boyfriend cheated on me recently, but that doesn't define my worth nor tie me to him indefinitely – it may be more about his shortcomings rather than mine. His indifference might be a reflection of his own issues, not my inadequacy. My feelings of being unloved or unwanted may stem from relying too heavily on external validation. Perhaps I need to work on self-love and self-validation. The belief that I'm ""annoying"" or ""never happy with anything"" could be cognitive distortions – maybe it's not that I'm never happy, but I've been focusing too much on the negative aspects of life recently. As for not having a family, there are other forms of support systems I could build, like friendships, networking groups, joining communities, etc. Rather than seeing myself as a problem, I could view these challenges as opportunities for self-development and growth."
52,all-or-nothing thinking,I can't do anything right and I'm crying over spilling cereal on my bed and dress And I think I'm worthless,"While it is true that I'm upset over spilling cereal, this small mistake doesn't determine my self-worth. Everyone makes mistakes and it's okay to feel upset about them. I should remember that this moment of frustration doesn't need to define my entire day, let alone my self-image. Instead, I can use this as a learning opportunity to improve, and realize that sometimes accidents happen and it's perfectly human to go through moments of struggle. This does not make me worthless, but rather gives me a chance to demonstrate resilience.
"
53,overgeneralizing,"I cant work out what my real personality is because my opinions and moods change all the time and Its like I change into different personalities kind of but its not different conciousmesses its just i dont know how to explain it but I think im insane because I dont know much about who I am because who I am changes and it can change very fast, is this normal? And I think i have no stable identity and I dont know why or if its normal","It could be that I'm merely experiencing standard fluctuations in mood and personality, a common characteristic of human nature and not necessarily a symptom of insanity. Perhaps I am more self-aware and sensitive to these changes than others, making it appear abnormal from a personal standpoint. It's also possible that my viewpoint is affected by my level of stress or current life challenges, which could cause rapid changes in self-perception. Maybe it's not that I don't have a stable identity, but I am multifaceted and adaptable, able to adjust my behavior and attitudes according to different situations and environments. It might be helpful to explore this further with a psychologist, who can provide professional insight and guidance."
54,all-or-nothing thinking,I completely overreacted to my teenage son's grades. And I think Why isn't this kid applying himself?,Perhaps my son is struggling with understanding the material and he's too afraid to ask for help. Maybe there's an underlying issue such as ADHD or a learning disability that is affecting his performance. It could also be that he is dealing with stress or potential bullying and it's impacting his ability to concentrate on his studies. There might be distractions at home that are taking his focus away from studying. He might also be more vested in other interests or activities that he places higher importance on than academic achievement.
55,"mind reading,negative feeling or emotion,catastrophizing","I confronted a coworker about eating my food from the refrigerator, only to realize the custodians threw away my food the night before. And I think My coworkers are making fun of me now","It's possible that my coworkers appreciate and respect that I confronted the issue head-on. Perhaps they're even making jokes because they're trying to lighten the mood, not because they're making fun of me. The custodians might have made an honest mistake rather than purposely throwing away my food. This might be a good chance for me to assert more control over my environment, like labeling my food, or even bringing it back home after work. Future similar situations may lead to me growing more assertive about my boundaries."
56,blaming,I couldn't find my bank card and realized my husband must have taken it. And I think He shouldn't have taken it without asking me first.,It's possible that I misplaced my bank card somewhere and simply can't find it right now. My husband could have borrowed it for a legitimate reason and maybe he didn't think it was necessary to ask as I've allowed him to use it freely in the past. Perhaps he needed it for an emergency situation and didn't have the opportunity or time to discuss it with me first. It could also be that he meant to tell me but forgot and will probably let me know later.
57,labeling,I couldn't finish the task in time And I think I'm incompetent,"Even though I couldn't finish the task in time, it could be due to a number of reasons, not necessarily incompetence. Perhaps I had not allocated my time efficiently, or the task was more complex than I had initially anticipated. It might also be that I was facing other personal or professional distractions that were affecting my productivity. This single instance does not define my overall abilities or worth. It might be helpful to reassess how I approach my tasks, maybe even ask others for assistance or input if necessary, and remember to care for myself both physically and mentally to maintain my work efficiency."
58,all-or-nothing thinking,I did badly in a writing contest I entered. I did not final. And I think I am a bad writer.,"Maybe I should try to see this situation from a different perspective. The outcome of the contest does not necessarily reflect my abilities as a writer. Even great writers face rejection at times, it's part of the creative process. Getting feedback can be a valuable tool for improvement. Perhaps the judgement in the contest was subjective, or my style didn't match the judges’ tastes. It doesn't mean I am a bad writer. I can continue to practice and improve my writing skills. It could also be beneficial to explore other genres or writing styles, join a writing group, or enroll in a creative writing class to refine my skills further."
59,all-or-nothing thinking,I did nothing with my day And I think Don't feel like I deserve fun/enjoyment,"Perhaps, I went through a day where I didn't accomplish what I had planned and I feel down about it. But instead of being hard on myself, I should accept that there will be days like these and that it's okay. Maybe this is my body's way of telling me that it needs rest. Even on a day perceived as unproductive, I do things that are necessary for my wellbeing like eating, sleeping, or even simply breathing. I should also remind myself that enjoyment is not something to be earned or deserved, it's something naturally needed by humans to balance our lives. So I should allow myself some fun or enjoyment, regardless of how productive or not my day was. This could also be a chance for me to reconsider my daily goals and set more manageable tasks for myself.
"
60,"mind reading,negative feeling or emotion,fortune telling,magnification",I did things that made my group look bad And I think They hate me.,"Although I made some mistakes that might have temporarily disappointed my group, it doesn't necessarily mean they hate me. Everyone makes mistakes and it is part of the learning process. They may be upset about the situation, not necessarily with me as a person. Moreover, my assumption that they ""hate"" me could be a misunderstanding or overgeneralization made in the heat of the moment. It might be more productive to talk to them about it, apologize if necessary and ask for feedback in order to ensure such situations do not occur again in the future."
61,disqualifying the positive,I didn't complete the tasks that I had written down earlier today. And I think Getting abused was my fault,"Instead of blaming myself for not completing the tasks, I will take this as an opportunity to improve my planning and time management skills because everybody struggles with task completion at some point. Also, considering that the abuse was my fault just adds to the guilt and pain; however, it's essential to understand that nobody deserves to be abused under any circumstance. It is the abuser who is at fault, not me. I should focus on healing and empowering myself rather than drowning in guilt. It might be beneficial to seek professional assistance to work through these feelings."
62,disqualifying the positive,I didn't get as good of feedback on a work assignment as I wanted And I think I didn't do as good a job as I thought,"It could be that I judged my own performance too harshly. Maybe the feedback wasn't as bad as I perceived it. Perhaps the assignment was challenging and meeting my own expectations may have been unrealistic under those circumstances. My performance on one job doesn't define my overall capabilities and this could be an opportunity to learn and improve. Additionally, I should also consider that feedback is subjective and the person reviewing might have had different expectations. Maybe I need to clarify what is expected from me for future assignments."
63,"all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion",I do gas stations audits and I messed up and forgot something I was supposed to do And I think I felt like a failure and am ashamed I made this mistake,"While I did make a mistake during the gas stations audits, it does not make me a complete failure. Everyone makes mistakes and it's a part of human nature, a part of the learning process. I could have forgotten the task due to a multitude of factors including stress, workload, or simple oversight. I may have overthought this incident. Forgetting something is not a reflection of my overall competence or value. Instead of feeling ashamed about this, I can take this as a learning opportunity to be more mindful and organized in my future tasks. I am capable and certainly more than this one mistake."
64,overgeneralizing,I don't know why I am writing the essay And I think Nobody cares what I have to say,"While I may initially feel uncertain over writing this essay, I can try to understand that this is a process to express my feelings, thoughts and ideas. I should remember that my expressions and perspectives are unique, and they do have value to others. There might be people who genuinely care about my perspective or find my viewpoint enlightening. Even though it feels like nobody cares about what I say, it's also possible that they can't understand or appreciate my thoughts as no proper medium was available previously. This essay provides me a chance for that. Even if others do not find it interesting, this is also a means for self-expression and self-reflection which is beneficial for me. I am writing for myself as much as I am writing for others."
65,labeling,"I don't work. I rely heavily on my partner, I'm so easily scared And I think I am a burden.","While it's true that I'm currently not working and rely on my partner for support, it's also possible that I'm contributing to the relationship in other meaningful ways. My feelings of fear could be seen as a sign of sensitivity and empathy, which are traits that can be positive in many situations. I may see myself as a burden, but considering my current vulnerabilities, it could also be an opportunity to seek professional help, grow, and regain my independence. Maybe, my partner sees my worth beyond my financial contribution, valuing me for my companionship, love, and other non-material aspects I bring into the relationship. This could be a phase in my life, not my entirety."
66,disqualifying the positive,I failed in everything And I think I'll never be able to do anything,"Failure doesn't define my abilities or my future. It's possible that I've not yet found what I'm good at or perhaps I need to approach objectives differently. There may have been contributing factors beyond my control in these instances of failure. I yet have a chance at success if I keep trying. I can learn from these experiences, refine my methods, and build resilience. The word 'never' is a strong one; we don't know what the future holds. Maybe, if I work on improving my skills, learning new things, or changing my strategy, I can still accomplish what I'm set to do. My past failures are not indicative of my future successes. I can seek help to find my potential and overcome obstacles."
67,"labeling,personalizing,catastrophizing",I failed to convince my son that he should go back to college And I think I am failing as a parent,"While it's disheartening that I couldn't persuade my son to return to college, it doesn't mean I'm a failure as a parent. Perhaps my son needs to discover the importance of education on his own, or maybe he has yet to find a career path that genuinely interests him, or maybe college is not the correct path for him. My role as a parent is to provide guidance and support, not to control or predetermine his life choices. My perceived failure could actually be an opportunity for growth and independence for my son, and a chance for me to learn unconditional acceptance as a parent."
68,"fortune telling,catastrophizing,negative feeling or emotion",I failed to do a work task appropriately in a side-gig. And I think I won't get paid,"While it's true that I made a mistake on a task in my side-gig, this doesn't necessarily mean I won't get paid. Maybe they'll give me a chance to correct my mistake or assign me a different task. Even if I don't get paid for this particular task, it doesn't mean I will always fail in my side-gig activities. I could view this as a learning experience to improve my skills and better understand the expectations for future tasks. Also, my value is not solely based on this one task. There are other ways I can generate income and prove my worth. Let's not forget that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and it's part of the growth process."
69,"catastrophizing,fortune telling",I failed to turn in my planned event calendar by the due date. And I think I forgot something important. Again. My boss is going to kill me.,"While it's true I failed to turn in my event calendar by the due date, it does not mean I'm a complete failure or I am constantly forgetting. My boss might be upset, but it doesn't mean she's going to fire me instantly. She knows I've been handling multiple tasks recently, and everybody can make mistakes. What's more important is how I handle this situation. Perhaps I can demonstrate resourcefulness and resilience by coming up with a plan to make amends. This setback could even serve as a stepping stone for improvement, helping me to establish an effective reminder system for the future. This situation is far from the end; it could be a new beginning."
70,labeling,I forgot to give my boss an important message when I was at work. The customer who left the message ended up being very angry because they had a problem that needed to be resolved My boss was pretty upset with me and the customer may take his business elsewhere And I think I feel like a failure,"While it's true that I forgot to deliver an important message to my boss, this single incident doesn't define my overall competence or performance at work. Everyone makes mistakes and it's part of the human condition. My boss was upset, which is a normal reaction, but it doesn't necessarily mean that our professional relationship is irreparably damaged. As for the customer, although they were initially angry, we can still address their concerns and possibly regain their trust with immediate action and an apology. I could potentially even turn this situation around by turning it into an opportunity to showcase our company's commitment to customer service. I shouldn't let this one mishap make me feel like a failure; instead, I will treat it as a valuable lesson to be more careful in the future.
"
71,all-or-nothing thinking,"I found a job I thought was perfect for me in the field I used to work in and love very much. A few days after putting in a resume and lining up several references, I found out the job was filled and I didn't even get so much as an acknowledgment of my application much less an interview when I was extremely qualified. And I think why can't I ever get anything I want","Even though I didn't land the job I thought was perfect, it could be that there are other opportunities out there funnelling in that are actually a much better fit for my skills and knowledge or even conduct an even more fulfilling role. Perhaps the company had internal candidates or there might have been some factors beyond my control. I shouldn't take non-response to my application as a personal rejection. This scenario does not dictate my future possibilities of success or options I have in my field. What if this occurrence is redirecting me to something better? It could be pushing me towards growth or to reassess my choices and come up with alternative career paths. My value is not determined by this single rejection and it's important for me to remember that everyone faces professional setbacks. There could be numerous reasons why I didn't get the job that have everything to do with the business and nothing to do with me personally."
72,all-or-nothing thinking,I gained a little weight while trying to diet And I think I'm not succeeding,"While it's true that I gained a little weight, it doesn't necessarily indicate failure. Maybe my body is adjusting to the new diet plan, or perhaps I'm gaining muscle mass through exercise, which actually means my diet and fitness plan is working. Weight is just one measurement of success, and there are other signs of progress I should also consider, like having more energy or feeling less stressed. In addition, I should remind myself that progress takes time - I can't expect instant results. Success in dieting is about building sustainable habits over time, not immediate weight loss.
"
73,disqualifying the positive,I gained weight And I think I feel like I need to die to be happy.,"While it's true that I've gained weight, this does not define my self-worth or happiness. There are multiple ways to improve my health and self-image such as adopting a healthier lifestyle, working out regularly, seeking professional nutritional advice, or going to a weight loss group. Instead, I can choose to focus on accepting and loving myself as I am right now because self-acceptance is key to happiness. Also, the thought of death should not be associated with happiness. If these feelings of despair persist, I'll seek immediate professional help because mental health is equally important."
74,negative feeling or emotion,I get so annoyed and frustrated when my baby cries And I think i am a terrible mom,"While it's normal to feel frustrated when my baby cries, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm a terrible mom. In fact, all parents go through moments of struggle and self-doubt. It's possible I could benefit from learning new techniques for soothing my baby or managing my own stress during challenging moments. Maybe I could ask experienced parents I know for advice, or speak to my pediatrician about my baby's crying. I could also consider attending a parenting support group or seeking therapy to better handle these feelings of self-criticism. Remember, feeling frustration doesn't dictate the quality of my motherhood."
75,blaming,I got a parking ticket because my sister forgot to register for overnight parking in front of my house. And I think I am responsible for her mistakes.,"It's possible that the parking ticket was a result of a simple oversight on my sister's part and not necessarily a reflection on me or my responsibility. In some instances, responsibility lies on the person who performs the action. This could be a learning opportunity for both of us, where my sister learns about the consequences of forgetting to register for overnight parking and I learn about setting clear expectations with those who are visiting and parking at my house. Ultimately, though I'm frustrated, I can choose to view this as a minor inconvenience, rather than a personal failure."
76,catastrophizing,I got excessively angry at my friend for sending stupid pictures of me to a mutual friend. I felt betrayed and that was extreme And I think Why did I overact like this,"It's possible my reaction was elevated because I've been feeling stressed or overwhelmed with other areas of my life and this incident was simply a catalyst. Or perhaps they were unaware that sharing those photos against my will would make me uncomfortable, so my anger might be a reaction towards unspoken boundaries being crossed. Additionally, I might be feeling insecure about how I look and the pictures have triggered those feelings of self-consciousness. Instead of solely focusing on my reaction, I would rethink why it bothered me so much and what underlying issues it might be revealing. Reflecting on whether I need to have a conversation about boundaries with my friend or working on improving my self-image, could be some possible means of resolution. To ensure I react less violently to similar situations in the future, I could look into developing my emotional regulation skills.  This could also point to a larger pattern of reacting intensely to situations, indicating underlying mental health issues that I should probably further explore with my psychologist."
77,labeling,I got in a fight with my roommate over the bathroom And I think He's so damn inconsiderate,"Maybe my roommate isn't aware that he's being inconsiderate and it could just be a difference in our living styles. I should talk it out with him and explain how his behavior impacts me. Perhaps he was having a bad day, or he's under a lot of stress lately which could be why he acted out. It's also possible that I might be overreacting because I too had a stressful day, and it could be helpful if I try to practice more patience and understanding towards my roommate."
78,catastrophizing,I got into a minor car crash. And I think I messed up big time.,"Although I got involved in a minor car crash, it's not entirely my fault. Accidents happen and it's part of the learning process. I'm grateful that it was minor and no one got seriously injured. This experience will make me more cautious and aware while driving, thereby improving my overall driving skills. In this context, it's not necessarily a major mess-up but a chance for growth and development."
79,personalizing,I got upset at my boss for not putting me in a temporary promotion to act as supervisor of our team. And I think I wasn't valued as much as the other person.,"Perhaps my boss chose the other person for reasons beyond my comprehension - factors that aren't necessarily a reflection of how they value me. Maybe they chose the other person because of their specific skills, experience or their ability to handle added stress at this time. It's equally possible that they didn't want to overload me with the responsibilities of a supervisor, considering my current workload. Maybe they believe that I am more efficient and required in the current position. Alternatively, it could also be that they have different plans for my career growth. It's not necessarily a reflection of my value or capability."
80,should statements,I got very upset last week when I realized that I had forgotten to fill out a required form and the date that the form was due had already passed. And I think they should have reminded me before I forgot,"While it's unfortunate that I missed the deadline, it's also possible that I had too much on my plate that caused me to forget. In future, I should employ strategies like setting reminders or using a planner to keep track of essential tasks like this one. Also, it might have been helpful if they had sent a reminder, but I shouldn't solely rely on others for such responsibilities. I'll communicate my concern but also work on being more proactive and dependable."
81,personalizing,I had a breakup And I think I am the cause of the breakup,"Maybe the breakup is simply a byproduct of larger compatibility issues that we both were overlooking or unaware of. Each individual contributes to the dynamics of a relationship, so it might not be only my fault. Perhaps we both share the fault, or maybe neither of us are truly at fault and our relationship simply was not meant to last. It's also possible that our breakup was shaped by external factors outside of our control. Alternatively, the breakup could serve as a chance for me to learn and grow, understanding my strengths and weaknesses better for future relationships. Consider that I might be overestimating my role in the breakup due to blame or guilt."
82,"magnification,negative feeling or emotion",I had a complaint against my work which I felt unnecessary to bring to my attention as it was very minor. And I think There was no need to even say anything it was very minor.,"While I initially felt aggrieved about the minor complaint at my work, I could potentially view it as an opportunity to improve my performance. Perhaps the person who raised it is detail-oriented and noticing these minor issues is part of their job. Additionally, it could be a sign of a robust feedback system where every issue, no matter how minor, is not overlooked. It could also be an example of my high expectations of myself and my sensitivity to criticism, which is something I could work on with the psychologist. Furthermore, if other people are managing and dealing with complaints better than I am, this could serve as motivation to learn and adopt their managing strategies, turning this minor annoyance into a learning opportunity."
83,"catastrophizing,overgeneralizing,fortune telling,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,mind reading","I had a disagreement about our finances with my partner at our home about a week ago that caused her to leave the apartment and not talk, call, or text me for hours. And I think I worried that she might break up with me and that I'd never see her again.","Although we had a serious disagreement over our finances which caused her to leave the apartment for a few hours, it's possible she just needed some time to cool off and think things through. Just because we had a fight doesn't mean she's considering breaking up; everyone has disagreements, particularly about finances, and taking a break can often be helpful for clearing one's mind and returning to the situation with a fresh perspective. Maybe she hasn't reached out yet because she's also worried about the fight escalating and wants to approach it in a calm manner. I can also take initiative to talk in a constructive way."
84,labeling,"I had a huge fight with my friend and I love her so much and I called her fat and ugly and I didn't mean to, is there a condition for something like this And I think I'm being mean to someone I love","Perhaps I was projecting my own insecurities onto my friend during our argument and I need to find a healthier way to manage those feelings. I might be intolerant to stress or lack crucial communication abilities which resulted in the offensive outburst. Instead of channeling stress and insecurity negatively, I could utilize more productive measures like meditating or physical exercise. It could also indicate underlying anger management issues that I need professional help with. Or maybe, it's reflective of a pattern of self-sabotage where I sabotage my closest relationships due to fear of intimacy or commitment, all of which require psychological help. We might also consider the possibility of a personality disorder if this pattern continues across multiple relationships and settings."
85,"personalizing,all-or-nothing thinking",I had an opportunity to get a large bonus at work but I did not do well on task so no bonus And I think I could have done so much better,"Although I didn't receive the large bonus at work this time, I have identified areas for potential improvement and can utilize this experience to enhance my future performance. Failing to succeed once doesn't define my overall capabilities or future chances. I appreciate that I had the opportunity to learn from this experience and it has given me the motivation to work harder, thus increasing the likelihood of earning a bonus next time. Furthermore, additional bonuses and opportunities are bound to come my way as long as I continue to strive for excellence."
86,comparing and despairing,"I had been working on a project at work for a very long time, but a higher up manager contacted my boss and asked about it, insinuating I wasn't delivering it fast enough. And I think I'm working on this as fast as I possibly can","The manager reaching out might not necessarily be questioning my capabilities or efficiency. It could be that he just needs an update or he's under pressure himself. Alternatively, he might be looking to assist or provide additional resources to expedite the project. Maybe he's trying to reallocate some work and wants to understand every team's work capacity. It's also possible he's not aware of the complexity of the project I'm working on. Plus, I know I'm working as quickly and efficiently as I can, which means my conscience is clear."
87,disqualifying the positive,I had dinner plans cancelled by my parents because I my mom was feeling under the weather. And I think I never get to see her anymore.,"While it's unfortunate that the dinner plans with my parents were cancelled, perhaps it's not entirely due to my mom's health. It could be that they had an unexpected issue or other commitments that came up. In light of this, it would be helpful to have a communication with my parents regarding how I feel, expressing my desire to spend more time with them. Additionally, I could proactively make plans for future dinners or meets, propose alternatives when primary plans aren't feasible, or even arrange for virtual meetings when physical meetups aren't possible."
88,mind reading,"I had tentative plans to get together with friends last week, but they never got back to me. And I think they don't really like me","It's possible that my friends were genuinely busy and forgot to reply, which is a common thing everyone experiences at times. It might not necessarily mean that they don't like me. I may just be overthinking their lack of response. I could try reaching out to them again and see what happens. Also, this could be an opportunity for me to look for other groups of friends and diversify my social engagement. This one instance should not define my self-worth or general likability."
89,fortune telling,I have a flight in the evening And I think Something will go wrong on my flight today,"While it's understandable to be nervous about flying, the possibility of anything going wrong is extremely low given the rigorous safety standards that airlines maintain. Perhaps the weather will be perfect for a smooth flight, I will have a delightful conversation with passengers, enjoy pleasant service from the flight crew, and arrive at my destination relaxed and refreshed. Remembering that statistics are in my favor can help alleviate my fears. Moreover, this flight is an opportunity for me to overcome my fear, practice mindfulness, and work on building my resilience. Overall, focusing on the positive aspects can greatly help me to navigate through this challenge."
90,catastrophizing,"I have anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and when I asked if I have ptsd my therapist said I have (whatever). The longest job I had was five months, and majority of my jobs have been part time seasonal work. about as long as worked anywhere else too. I get bored, and my mental illnesses make it hard too. And I think I’ll never be able to hold a job.","While I acknowledge that my mental health struggles make it challenging for me to maintain stable employment, I realize it doesn't mean I'll never be able to hold a job. Rather than viewing my history of part-time and seasonal work as a negative, I could see it as an opportunity to have gained diverse experiences in various industries. Feeling bored could be a sign that I haven't found my true passion or optimal work environment. Rather than focusing on a traditional 9-5 job, I could explore flexible or freelance work that allows me to create my schedule based on my mental wellness needs. This could also provide me with more control over my work environment. With a focused treatment plan, guidance from my therapist, and possible career counseling, I can hopefully manage my mental health better and increase my chances for future job stability."
91,negative feeling or emotion,"I have been studying for months for the real estate exam. When I went to take it, I did not pass by two points. And I think I really have to pass, I need to work.","Although I've been studying for months, I unfortunately missed passing the real estate exam by a narrow margin. However, this doesn't mean I'm not capable. It could be an indication that perhaps I overlooked some topic areas, faced exam stress, or it was just not my day. I can consider this setback as an opportunity to look for gaps in my knowledge, and enhance my understanding for next time. Besides that, I can also engage in better test-taking strategies or join preparatory classes. On the other hand, there are varied avenues available that could meet my need to work now. I could consider temporary job opportunities in the meantime, or look for intern roles in the field of real estate to gain practical experience. This can help build my career in the long run and prepare me better for the exam next time. Hence, failing an exam is not a dead-end but a stepping stone to explore and learn more."
92,"mind reading,overgeneralizing,catastrophizing","I have been trying to get a hold of a friend to help me with a project for over a week, but he won't return my calls or texts. And I think He is avoiding me","It's possible that my friend is just really busy right now. They could be going through a personal situation, such as a family emergency or health issue that I'm unaware of. It's also possible that my messages have somehow been lost or overlooked in a backlog of messages. The project we're working on may be stressing them out and they need some space to work things out. Alternatively, they might not feel capable of helping with the project and are unsure of how to convey that. It may not be about me at all, but rather about them and their current circumstances."

The past 3 weeks have been especially tough depression wise, due to some out of our control stressors. spent a lot of time in bed while my kids were in school, just doing the bare minimum.  Meanwhile, my very supportive husband has been picking up my slack. I feel as though I nearly contribute to the household chores as much as I should, though I thank him constantly for his work.  Any words of wisdom or encouragement? And I think I feel like a bad wife and mom","I'm suffering from mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety; several unforeseen incidents recently have aggravated my situation. For the last few weeks, I've had to rely heavily on my undeniably supportive husband, who's stepped in to fulfill our household responsibilities, as I've been somewhat incapacitated and spending lots of time in bed during school hours. My contribution in terms of home chores has been minimal, which I acknowledge and I constantly express gratitude to my husband for his help. I seem to struggle with feelings of guilt and inadequacy related to my perceived roles as a wife and mother. What can you suggest?"
94,mind reading,I hurt my families feelings by canceling the trip they had planned to come to see me. And I think I should have made time for them.,"Although I canceled the trip and possibly hurt my family's feelings, I believe I made the decision considering my own well-being or important obligations that couldn't be postponed. In retrospect, not every decision we make is perfect or liked by everyone. Hence, different variables could have led to different decisions. I can choose to explain to them sincerely my situation and reasons for canceling the trip which may lead to them understanding and respecting my decision. Alternatively, I could plan another trip or meeting when I am better able to accommodate their visit. This can be seen as a learning experience to coordinate better plans for future visits."
95,labeling,I hurt my family members by telling them to postpone their long-planned trip to visit me because I was too busy And I think I am selfish,"I requested my family to reschedule their trip to see me due to my workload. While I initially felt guilty and selfish for doing so, I could alternatively view this situation from a different perspective. Maybe I was demonstrating responsibility and prioritizing my professional commitments, which also contributes to my family's well-being in the long run. Or, my decision gave my family flexibility, giving them an opportunity to rearrange their journey to a more convenient time. In fact, I was ensuring that I could give them my full attention during their visit, making their trip more meaningful."
96,labeling,I invited a co-worker out and they turn me down And I think They will never want to go out with me,"Perhaps my co-worker had a prior engagement or is facing some personal issue that prevented them from accepting my invitation. There's also a possibility that they are not comfortable mingling with colleagues outside of work or they might be overloaded with work. Maybe they just weren't in the mood for going out at that particular instance. It could have less to do with me and more with their own circumstances. There will be other opportunities to invite them again, and their response might be different next time."
97,"catastrophizing,personalizing",I invited a co-worker out and they turned me down And I think They will never want to go out with me,"It could be that my co-worker had a pre-existing commitment and was legitimately unable to accept my invitation at this time. It's possible they would be open to going out in the future, but the timing was just off for this occasion. Or maybe they are going through a personal issue and are currently not open to socializing. There could be a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with me personally. I shouldn't make assumptions based on a single encounter and should try asking again when the time is more suitable. Even if they don't want to go out with me, there are plenty of others who would enjoy my company. It's essential to maintain a positive attitude and not let one rejection affect my self-esteem."
98,"comparing and despairing,disqualifying the positive",I just don't care about myself And I think Everyone is more important than me,"It's possible that I've been prioritizing others over myself due to societal or personal expectations. However, it's just as important to take care of my own mental and physical health. Maybe I'm not less important, but I've been neglecting my own needs and feelings which might lead to these thoughts. Everyone has their own worth, including me. It's necessary to value myself as well. If I start taking care of myself more, maybe I'll start realizing my worth and feel that I matter as much as anyone else."
99,negative feeling or emotion,I just feel unmotivated And I think I just can't get moving,"Although I'm feeling unmotivated and stuck at the moment, it's possible that this feeling is temporary. Perhaps I'm just experiencing a rut or going through a stressful period that's causing this lack of motivation. It's also possible that there are underlying issues contributing to this feeling, such as physical health problems, that I haven't addressed yet. Maybe I could try finding a new hobby or some form of physical activity to rekindle my motivation. It could also be beneficial to seek support from friends or family, or even speak with a professional about these feelings. It's also okay to accept that everyone has periods of being unmotivated, and it doesn't mean I'll never move forward again."
100,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling",I just got fired from working as a sales person because I didn't reach my quota. I had never had a job like this before this. And I think I'm a failure and can't keep a sales person job.,"I lost my sales job because I didn't meet the quota, which wasn't something I've encountered in my previous work life. While it's a setback, it doesn't necessarily mean I can't maintain a sales job. Maybe this particular sales role or the company's expectations weren't suitable for me. It could also be that I'm still acquiring the necessary skills and experience in this field. Alternatively, perhaps sales isn't my strong suit and I might excel in another line of work. Losing this job doesn't equate to failure, but rather a learning growth opportunity for future endeavors."
101,disqualifying the positive,"I keep pushing myself towards new things. I keep working, studying, socializing, exercising. I'm doing far more thab anyonr I know and I still go to sleep every night, hoping I won't wake up. And I think I'm everything I can and I still feel like shit","I am continuously seeking self-improvement by exploring various activities like work, study, and socializing. I'm highly committed, aligning my life with productive tasks and exercises frequently. Despite exceeding my own expectations and those of others, I battle with feelings of emptiness at the end of the day, wishing I won't open my eyes the next morning. Maybe I'm enduring too much; it might be the time to reassess my priorities. This constant feeling of discontent could be an indication that I'm possibly not focusing on the right things in life or not giving myself the credit I deserve. Instead of comparing my deeds with others, I should focus more on personal satisfaction, mental peace, and self-care."
102,labeling,I know why I am so angry all of the time. like I have this little monster in my head. It just makes me want to abandon everything and hide from everyone so I lash out anymore. I just hate my brain. And I think I am crazy.,"I am feeling intense anger and frustration frequently, it's as if there's a mischievous entity living within me, constantly pushing me to the edge. Perhaps there's an underlying reason that's yet to be understood, which may be causing this emotional turmoil. Sometimes, it feels like distancing from everything and everyone is the best solution, as a means to prevent any potential harm or discomfort to others. Instead of hating myself for these feelings, maybe I can learn to understand them better. I could be dealing with a mental health issue, and seeking help from a professional isn't a sign of being crazy, it's a step towards understanding and healing."
103,fortune telling,"I left a toxic job that abused me for 12 years. I thought I found a new job that was better, but realized they lied to me about the job and now I hate working here. I feel like I made a huge mistake. And I think I can never get a break. Every time I try to make a positive change in my life, something happens to ruin it.","While it's true that I left a toxic job and the new job hasn't turned out as expected, it also signals my ability to make changes in pursuit of my happiness. Perhaps this job isn't my ideal, but it's not the end. It's a stepping stone towards new possibilities. Sometimes things are not as they initially seem, this has uncovered my skills of recognizing unsuitable conditions. Yes, it seems difficult now, but that doesn't mean it will always be. Every experience is a chance to learn, grow, and develop resilience. This period of my life could be preparing me for something great in the future. A series of unfortunate events doesn't mean I will never get a break; it simply means the right opportunity is still out there waiting for me to discover it."
104,all-or-nothing thinking,"I lost my best friend. I'm a male and she was the nicest girl I've ever met. But I fucked it. I started to take her for granted, started to overthink, to take everything too seriously, I was jealous, selfish and though only of my own interests and not of hers feelings And I think it's all my fault","It's true that I've lost a cherished friendship, and I feel deeply responsible for the rupture. However, it's also just as possible that we both had a hand in what transpired. Possibly, she also had her faults and there was a lack of communication from both our ends. Maybe my jealousy and selfishness were not entirely unjustified - there could be circumstances I was reacting to that prompted these emotions. It's worth critically examining whether I was solely taking my interests into account or I was also involving her feelings but they were not reciprocated or understood. It might not be entirely my fault, as relationships are a two-way dynamic, and it could be a mixture of actions, words and circumstances from both sides that led to the fallout."
105,negative feeling or emotion,I lost my house And I think I want to die,"Losing my house is undoubtedly a severe setback, which has overwhelmed me with unexpected turmoil and despair. However, I need to remember that this is just a material loss, not the loss of my potential or my future. There are possibilities for me to recover from this disaster and recreate my life. It's going to be a challenge, but I have resilience within me. Now, I am focusing on exploring solutions, seeking help from government relief programs, friends, family, or community organizations. I also remember that it's essential to reach out to mental health professionals during this tough time to manage my emotions and thoughts effectively. Moreover, maybe this loss could open new doors for me to a simplified lifestyle or a new environment that I might end up appreciating more."
106,catastrophizing,I love two people at the same time And I think That I'm going to fail,"While it might feel overwhelming and confusing to have strong feelings for two people at the same time, it does not mean I am doomed for failure. This could potentially be an opportunity for me to discover more about myself and what I truly want in a relationship. Perhaps the feelings I have for these two people reflect different aspects of what I value and need. By consulting a psychologist, I am being proactive in understanding my emotions and learning how to effectively manage them. It's not a guarantee of disaster; rather, it could be a point of personal growth."
107,"overgeneralizing,fortune telling,all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion,labeling,should statements,catastrophizing,magnification",I made a goal to quit smoking and failed And I think I keep failing at this,"It's true that I haven't been successful in my goal to quit smoking yet, but this does not necessarily mean I'm perpetually doomed to fail. Perhaps I need to approach this challenge from a different angle or try new methods to quit smoking. Maybe I can try nicotine gums, patches or seek support from counseling or support groups. I should also consider that overcoming addiction takes time and multiple attempts. Just because I didn't succeed this time doesn't mean I won't in the future. Failure is often part of the process to success."
108,"fortune telling,overgeneralizing","I made a joke that fell flat in front of someone I just met, and that person left the room. And I think People will never perceive me as acting naturally in social situations.","While it's true that I made a joke that didn't land with someone new and they left the room, it might not be as critical as I'm making it out to be. They could have left the room for reasons unrelated to my joke, perhaps they needed to use the restroom or received a message they needed to answer. It's unreasonable to believe that one uncomfortable social interaction will define all future encounters. Maybe people perceive me as someone who is not afraid to take risks in conversations or someone who has their unique sense of humor. Also, my 'acting naturally' is subjective to various perspectives; what seems unnatural to me might appeal to others. This could be an opportunity to recalibrate my approach, dispense humor more comfortably, and keep the situations light, to feel more natural and authentic to myself."
109,"emotional reasoning,labeling,negative feeling or emotion",I made a mistake with an expensive reagent at work and ruined my experiment. And I think I'm mad at myself for being careless,"While it's true that I made a mistake at work with a costly reagent that impacted my experiment, it's also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it's a fundamental part of the learning process. The error can be used as a stepping stone to improve my skills and attention to detail. Also, it's a chance to evaluate the working procedures, identify the possibilities of error and improve them to prevent future mistakes. Instead of being mad at myself for being careless, I could view this as a growth opportunity and forgive myself for this mishap."
110,disqualifying the positive,I made very good English presentation but I got nervous because of the amount of people and I forgot my text And I think I'm scared to present in front of other people and I panic,"While it's true that I got nervous and forgot my text during the presentation, I should also consider the fact that I managed to create a very good English presentation in the first place. This shows that I have knowledge, creativity, and skill. The nervousness could have been due to an unfamiliar situation or environment, which is something a lot of people face and can be managed with practice and preparation. It's possible that I'm not generally scared to present in front of others, but the amount of people this time was more than I was used to. Also, I may not necessarily panic in every presentation situation; this could have been a one-time occurrence. Instead of generalizing this one experience, I could look at it as an opportunity to learn and build my presentation skills further.
"
111,negative feeling or emotion,I missed a personal deadline for a project a friend asked me to help with. And I think I made a deadline and missed it.,"It's possible that my friend understands my circumstances and is more lenient than I expect. Maybe this project wasn't as time-sensitive as I thought. Even though I missed the deadline, I can still complete the work and apologize for the delay. Perhaps there are factors contributing to my delay that I need to address, such as inefficient time management or too heavy of a workload. Maybe I need to start setting more realistic deadlines that accommodate my busy schedule. I could also consider involving others to help spread the work."
112,"negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking",I mixed up the addresses on two packages and sent them to the wrong place And I think I screwed up again at work,"While I made a mistake at work by sending two packages to the wrong addresses, this does not mean that I habitually mess up. It's possible that I was simply distracted or stressed, which impacted my attention to detail. At other times, I've been thorough and accurate in my tasks. Making a mistake on occasions doesn't reflect my overall job performance. It's important to acknowledge the mistake, learn from it, and find strategies to avoid similar mistakes in the future, such as double-checking addresses before sending out packages. I should not let one instance of error define my abilities or performance at work."
113,personalizing,I posted a new piece of artwork online and people started comparing it with artwork created by others And I think I shouldn't have posted it,"Posting my artwork online is a step towards sharing my creativity with the world. Although the comparison with other artists feels disheartening, it can also serve as an opportunity to learn and grow in my artistic journey. Moreover, every artist has a unique style and perspective, making each piece valuable in its own right. The fact that people engaged with my artwork and made comparisons speaks volumes about its impact. This experience can be a stepping stone to embracing different perspectives and growing my resilience. Ultimately, it is a measure of my courage in expressing my creative self to the world. Whether or not the critics appreciate it or compare it, the most important thing is that it's a reflection of my unique voice and creativity."
114,overgeneralizing,I put in a lot of time on an Mturk task and was rejected on an attention request. I suggested a better way of handling these errors (automatic ejection) to the researcher and their answer showed they didn't understand my point. And I think I didn't explain this right.,"I spent considerable hours on an Mturk task, only to face rejection due to a disattention request error. I approached the researcher with an improved methodology for managing these mishaps, namely, automatic ejection. Their response, however, indicated a clear misunderstanding of my recommendation. Rather than blaming my explaining skills, perhaps they're not accustomed with such suggestions or simply lacking adequate comprehension skills. Another possibility could be a language barrier or perhaps they're already considering a similar solution. It's important to remember not all communication discrepancies are a reflection of my eloquence or articulation capabilities."
115,fortune telling,I received a rejection email from a position I applied to. And I think I will never get a job.,"Although I didn't secure this particular job, there are a host of other job opportunities available that could potentially be a better fit for me. Not getting this job doesn't imply that I am unfit for other roles. Instead, it could be that the role was not a perfect fit for my skills or experience level. Every rejection is a step towards the right direction as it is an opportunity to learn and improve. Failure is often a stepping stone towards success and not the endpoint. Next time, I'll make sure to prepare better and focus on improving my interview skills. I'm confident that I will find a job that suits me best."
116,"should statements,negative feeling or emotion","I received a subpar quiz score in a class. And I think I should have studied harder, or more efficiently.","It's also possible that I didn't perform well on my quiz due to other factors, not directly related to the intensity or efficiency of my studying. Maybe I was stressed or distracted on the day of the quiz, or maybe the subject just doesn't click with me as easily as other subjects do. Alternatively, I could also consider the possibility that despite my low score, I've still learned and retained information from my studying. Perhaps, compared to the past, I have improved but the quiz was more difficult than usual. Another perspective could be that the quiz score doesn't necessarily reflect my overall understanding of the topic. Lastly, this could be an opportunity for me to reassess my study strategies and seek additional resources, like a tutor or study group, instead of just studying harder."
117,emotional reasoning,I recently discovered a music artist that I very much enjoy. When I showed it to a close friend they had a very negative reaction and asked me how I could enjoy this type of music. I ended up getting quite angry with them and told them they had bad taste in music. And I think I felt that my personal self was under attack - and I needed to retaliate by denying their attack.,"Alternatively, this situation could have been approached differently. Instead of reacting defensively and attacking my friend's music taste, I could have recognized that everyone has different tastes in music and that's okay. I could have articulated that while I understand they might not enjoy this particular artist, their music resonates with me on a personal level. This might have led to a more understanding conversation about our differing tastes, instead of an argument. On a deeper level, I could also self-reflect on why I reacted so strongly and see this as an opportunity to better understand my triggers and work towards managing them in a more productive manner."
118,mind reading,I run a business with my close friend and we were taking work-related photos at their house. I took the memory card home but lost it while I was walking. And I think My friend is going to be angry with me,"Although it's natural to assume that my friend might be angry due to the loss of the memory card, it's also possible that they could understand that accidents happen and can easily forgive me. They might have backups of the photos or the photos might not be as crucial as I fear. Additionally, they could be more concerned about my well-being and the stress I'm experiencing over the loss, rather than the actual event. We could also seize this occurrence as an opportunity to improve our workflow, like using a cloud storage system for an immediate backup in the future."
119,"mind reading,all-or-nothing thinking",I saw a profile picture of a close friend on a dating app that I had feelings for. And I think I am not the kind of person that she would like to go out with.,"While initially it may be deflating to find a close friend on a dating app, there are many interpretations to this situation. First, consider that she might not know about my feelings for her, and hence, she's exploring her options. Alternatively, she could be on the dating app out of curiosity or for casual networking. There's also the possibility that our friendship could evolve into something more, given the right timing and circumstances. Rather than assume that I'm not her type, it might be worth having an open conversation about my feelings. Even if she doesn't share the same feelings, this situation could be an opportunity for personal growth and understanding my romantic preferences better. Lastly, her presence on the dating app doesn't necessarily correlate with my attractiveness or worthiness as a partner. Everyone has their own preferences, and it is essential to remember that self-worth should not be defined by others' perceptions."
120,negative feeling or emotion,I saw my best friend kissing with my long time crush And I think No one cares about me,"Maybe my friend and my crush were caught in an awkward situation and it may not mean that they have a romantic relationship. Perhaps, this is an opportunity for me to truly express my feelings to my crush rather than keeping them hidden. That being said, it's also a chance to have an open and honest conversation with my best friend about how I felt. It's important to remember that this one incident does not define my worth or how much people care for me. Outside of this situation, there are many people in my life who genuinely care about me and value our relationship."
121,mind reading,I saw my friend comment on an Instagram post when he's been ignoring me. And I think My friend doesn't like me anymore.,"There could be other reasons for my friend's behavior that aren't personal. They might be dealing with their own issues or perhaps they're overwhelmed with their tasks at the moment and haven't had the time to respond. Alternatively, it's also possible that they didn't get a chance to reply to me or saw my message and meant to respond, but then forgot. It could also be that they were casually scrolling through Instagram during a brief break or timeout and weren't really focusing on personal communications at that time."
122,personalizing,I sent a message to my friend and they did not reply And I think It must be my fault,"Perhaps my friend is busy at the moment or they might not have seen the message yet. They could also be dealing with their own issues and are not in a state to reply. Perhaps their phone is dead, or they are in a place with no service. There are also chances that they forgot to reply or they might have thought they already did. It's not necessarily my fault. That's just one possibility among many."
123,"mind reading,personalizing,negative feeling or emotion,fortune telling","I showed a new game idea I have to some friends I have in a chat room we all have together, but only 2 of them responded. And I think My friends aren't interested in my game idea","Perhaps my friends were preoccupied or busy at the time I shared my game idea so they didn't get a chance to respond. It's also possible that they may not have known how to react, or maybe they needed time to think about it before providing useful feedback. Not responding quickly or immediately does not necessarily indicate their lack of interest. It could also be that they are waiting to try out the game before giving their thoughts or they are not into games as much as I am."
124,"labeling,overgeneralizing,negative feeling or emotion",I talk to a close friend online every day because we live in different states. We share a lot about our lives and our messages are usually pretty long. My friend asked me to stop messaging for a while because they felt overwhelmed and wouldn't be able to respond but wanted to at a later time And I think I'm annoying and oversharing,"It could be that since my close friend and I live in different states and share so much of our lives daily, the frequency and length of our messages may have been overwhelming for them at this time. It's not necessarily that I'm annoying or oversharing, instead, they just might be going through something or they could be busier than usual. Maybe they need a little space to process our conversations or catch up with their other life activities. It's also possible that they usually enjoy our in-depth exchanges, but right now maybe they can't give the same energy. It could be a temporary situation and does not reflect on our relationship or my personality at all."
125,labeling,I think that I am fatter that everyone else but i am not And I think I'm worthless,"It could be my own perspective that makes me see myself as heavier than others, even when I'm not. This might be due to a self-esteem issue rather than reality. I may be feeling worthless at times, but that doesn't mean it's true. I'm capable of doing more than I realise, and I have qualities and skills that make me unique and valuable. It might be time to focus on positive attributes about myself rather than negative ones, and to consider seeking support from people who can help me see myself in a more positive light."
126,"blaming,negative feeling or emotion,overgeneralizing",I thought that my sister had taken some money from my house when she'd come over to visit. And I think I cannot trust my sister anymore.,"It is possible that I may have misplaced or used the money and forgotten about it, causing me to falsely believe that my sister took it. Alternatively, my sister may have borrowed the money for an immediate need and intended to speak to me about it later. Rather than jumping to conclusions and harming our relationship, I should have a calm, open discussion with her about what happened. The situation might be a misunderstanding, and keeping our communication lines open could prevent the unnecessary strain in our relationship. Misinterpretations can happen, so I need to consider all possibilities before I lose trust in my sister."
127,fortune telling,I took part in a writing competition and I lost And I think I will never become a successful writer,"While it's true that I did not win this writing competition, it doesn't mean I am a bad writer or I will never be successful. Many of the greatest authors faced rejections and failures on their path to success. This loss can serve as an opportunity for me to grow, to learn and improve my skills. Competitions are just one metric for success but it does not define my ability. I can continue writing, honing my skills, and even seeking feedback for improvement. I could look for other opportunities to submit my work or could consider self-publishing. Success is not always linear and this could be a stepping stone in my journey to become a successful writer."
128,should statements,I tried a new hair style but no one commented on it And I think I shouldn't have changed my hair,"Perhaps people didn't comment because they were too busy or distracted, or they didn't notice the change because they're not very observant. My hairstyle change could've been subtle, and people might not feel compelled to comment on it immediately. Even if no one commented, it doesn't mean that the change was not good or positive. It's important to remember that changing my hairstyle is more about how I feel about myself, and not about what others think. Changes, such as trying new hairstyles, can be exciting and refreshing, and it allows me to showcase creativity. Maybe people liked my new style but didn't verbalize it, possibly because they thought I'm confident enough not to need validation. My self-worth should not rely on others' comments or compliments. It's pivotal that I am the biggest fan of my choices and decisions, including my hair style!"
129,"labeling,comparing and despairing","I tried on my wedding dress in front of my family. My mother was excited and told me I was beautiful, but other members of my family made comments about my weight. I was told to not eat and exercise so I could be beautiful. And I think I'm a fat ugly troll.","Though some members of my family made negative comments about my weight when I tried on my wedding dress, my mother reassured me that I was beautiful. These differing opinions made me feel confused and hurt, leading to my perception of being overweight and unattractive. However, I recognize that beauty is subjective and I can also consider the idea that these comments may not be a reflection of my actual appearance, but rather their own standards or insecurities. I have the ability to see myself as beautiful regardless of others opinions and I can focus on exercising and eating healthy not for them, but for my own personal goals and well-being."
130,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling,overgeneralizing,negative feeling or emotion,mind reading,personalizing",I tried to advertise my business more but have gotten zero leads from it. And I think I am not good at what I do.,"While it's true that my current advertising strategy hasn't generated leads, this might be indicative of the need for refining my approach rather than a reflection on my professional abilities. Perhaps I need to explore different advertising platforms or create a more engaging campaign to better reach my target audience. Also, there could be other factors contributing to low lead generation unrelated to my skills or abilities. Seeking professional assistance in marketing could possibly shed more insight into this matter. Ultimately, it doesn't mean I am not good at what I do, it simply indicates a need for better advertising strategies."
131,all-or-nothing thinking,I tried to make a business but I lose And I think I'll never be able to do anything,"While I attempted to start a business and did not succeed, it is important to keep in mind that failure is often a stepping stone to success. Many successful entrepreneurs have experienced failures. I can take this as an opportunity to evaluate what went wrong and learn from my mistakes. This experience doesn't define me or my potential to succeed in the future. Instead of dwelling on this setback, I should focus on my strengths and what I can do to improve. I could also explore other avenues of interest, further my education, expand my skills or even partner with more experienced individuals in future endeavors."
132,"labeling,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,personalizing",I tried to make friends with people but they kept ignoring me. And I think I am not interesting,"Maybe I haven't found the right group of friends who appreciate me for who I am. Perhaps my interests are different than those I've tried connecting with. It could also be that I am not projecting my personality well enough or I'm not adequately portraying my interests, making it difficult for others to engage with me. I might be too focused on trying to interest others instead of also showing interest in them. Lastly, it might not necessarily be about me being 'interesting'; my expectations of friendship could be unrealistic or based off of social media, where interactions are often exaggerated."
133,fortune telling,I try to talk to a stranger at a party and they seem disinterested and walk away from me And I think I'm boring,"Perhaps the stranger at the party was already having a bad day and it's not about me being boring. Maybe they were distracted or they needed to be somewhere else at that moment. It's also possible that they were struggling with their own social anxieties. It could be more about their issues and less about me. Or perhaps we just didn't click on a personal level or share common interests, which doesn't necessarily mean I'm a boring person."
134,negative feeling or emotion,I want to shoot myself And I think I have lost all hope,"I am feeling incredibly low right now and everything seems terribly hopeless. However, I remember moments in the past when I've felt this way and things changed for the better eventually. Perhaps I can try to reach out to a close friend or family member who I trust and let them know what I'm going through, they might offer a fresh perspective or support that I need. Maybe I can also try to engage in activities that have brought me joy in the past, such as listening to my favorite music or going for a walk in the park. There might be professional resources available as well, like suicide hotlines and emergency mental health services, which could provide immediate assistance. This moment is challenging, but there are steps I can take to navigate it and things might not remain this bleak forever."
135,disqualifying the positive,I was addicted to heroin. And I think I don't deserve to get better.,"I am struggling with a heroin addiction and while currently I feel I may not deserve to get better, I can consider that it's only the guilty and self-critical part of me talking. Perhaps, I can start viewing my addiction as an illness, not a moral failure. I may have made some poor choices, but I deserved to be loved and taken care of just like anyone else. Turning to therapy and professional help is an acknowledgment of my will to get better. Maybe, improving my health and lifestyle could inspire others also battling addiction, making my journey to recovery a valuable experience, away from self-blame and guilt."
136,all-or-nothing thinking,I was at my Moms house today and we were talking about my job. She was shocked that I had been there for 15 years. She felt that it wasn't a good enough job. We were talking in the living room. She gasped as if that was insane. And I think My job is worthless,"While I was visiting my mother, we had a discussion about my career. Although she was surprised to know I've been at the same job for 15 years, her reaction wasn't necessarily negative or critical. Perhaps her shock was due to a different set of expectations or a generational gap in understanding what constitutes a successful career. Her gasp might have been out of surprise, not disdain. Therefore, I shouldn't immediately assume that my job is worthless just based on her reaction. She could even be impressed by my dedication and longevity with the company."
137,negative feeling or emotion,I was at work and sent info for an ad to our local newspaper. They called me later and said my boss had over-ridden everything and sent them new info. And I think He shouldn't assign me a task if he doesn't trust my work.,"My boss overrode the work I did for the advertisement even after he assigned it to me. However, this could mean he had some new ideas or input that he wanted to see reflected in the final version. It doesn't necessarily suggest that he doesn't trust my work. There could also be other reasons such as the target audience or the business needs have changed. I should discuss this with him to understand why he made changes to my work, and consider it as a learning opportunity to improve my skills for future tasks."
138,all-or-nothing thinking,I was called into a meeting with my boss where I was told that I wasn't meeting the standards at work. And I think I am not doing well enough to warrant working at this job.,"While the meeting with my boss was definitely challenging, it could also serve as a constructive feedback session to improve my work performance. The feedback I received may not be an outright condemnation of my abilities but rather a reflection of areas where I can improve upon. Keeping this perspective, I may be even more qualified for my current job as I can use this feedback to better myself. After all, everyone has a room for improvement. It could also be an opportunity to ask my boss for guidance in meeting the company’s expectations. Considering these possibilities, I should focus on how I can grow from this situation instead of viewing it entirely negatively."
139,"disqualifying the positive,all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion",I was driving home with my mother and we were talking about something. I said something stupid that didn't make sense and she called me out on it. And I think My opinions aren't valuable.,"Actually, the incident with my mother was an isolated event and it doesn't define the overall worth or value of my opinions. Everyone can make mistakes or say things that don't make sense from time to time, it doesn't negate their capability to have valuable ideas and insights. This can be considered a learning opportunity. I could use this to learn and grow, maybe I could learn to express my thoughts more logically or consider different perspectives before formulating my thoughts. Also, different opinions could be appreciated by different individuals, while my mother may not have agreed, others might find it valuable. Besides, the value of an opinion isn't defined by if people agree or disagree with it."
140,"all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion,fortune telling,overgeneralizing,labeling","I was given a solo for the church play.  At practice when it came time for me to sing, my voice cracked and I lost the solo. And I think I can't sing.","Despite my voice cracking during the church play practice, there could be other reasons than my belief that I can't sing. Perhaps I had not warmed up my voice properly prior, or maybe I was dehydrated that day which affected my vocals. It could be that the song was not suited to my range and that another song would better showcase my vocal capabilities. It's also possible that it was bad day, and that my singing would improve with some rest and practice. Additionally, the stress and nervousness of performing solo could have played a part in it too. I can use this experience as a growth opportunity, to explore my skills and work on my abilities under pressure."
141,all-or-nothing thinking,I was given a wrong dosage of medication by my Doctor.  I couldn't figure out why I felt so bad until I went back to see him. And I think Medication can be dangerous.,"The medication prescribed by my doctor had unexpected side effects that affected my wellbeing negatively, prompting me to revisit. It made me realize the importance of second opinions and constant monitoring in medical treatments. Rather than viewing medication as inherently dangerous, it could be seen as a double-edged sword that needs to be handled with care and precision. Understanding medication is not always perfect and side effects may occur, has boosted my active participation in my healthcare, encouraging better communication with my doctor and more focused research about my condition and its treatment to ensure a more well-rounded approach in my overall care."
142,mind reading,"I was greatly irritated, almost angry,  when a close friend reached out to me for assistance on taxes.  I usually do them, but I did not want to be bothered this year and felt almost used. And I think I feel my friend used me.","It's possible that my friend genuinely needed my help with their taxes and it's not about using me. They trust in my abilities and expertise in the area and didn't think it would bother me because I usually help. This year, I am feeling overwhelmed, and it's making me feel irritated easily, but this doesn't necessarily mean I was being taken advantage of. I should remember that I have the right to set boundaries and decline without feeling guilty. It is also a reminder to communicate my current state with my friend to ensure they understand and don't mistakenly misinterpret my actions. I could also take this as an opportunity to teach them how to do their taxes, empowering them while also relieving the burden from myself in future endeavors."
143,fortune telling,I was in my grandma's house and I knocked the vase on the floor And I think Grandma will be so angry at me,"Although I accidentally knocked the vase on the floor at my grandma's house, it's possible she won't be angry with me because she understands it was an accident. She might be glad it wasn't something more serious, like an injury. Alternatively, she could have been looking for an excuse to get rid of the old vase. This could be a chance to show my responsibility and maturity by apologizing and offering a solution, like cleaning up or replacing the vase. She might appreciate these acts, showing her that I value her feelings and respect her property."
144,mind reading,I was looking forward to relaxing but my partner asked me to make dinner instead. And I think My partner thinks I am lazy.,"Instead of immediately assuming that my partner thinks I'm lazy, perhaps they just had a tiring day and needed some support. Maybe they believe I'm a better cook and they wanted to enjoy a meal prepared by me. It could also be that they thought cooking together would give us some quality time. Alternatively, maybe they were just thoughtlessly asking without considering that I wanted to unwind. Instead of feeling annoyed, I could communicate my feelings with them and set boundaries or negotiate tasks."
145,catastrophizing,I was not paying attention and scratched someone's car while driving And I think I am will have to pay for this,"While it's true I may have to pay for the damages caused due to the accident, there's also the possibility that the car owner and I can come to an understanding. Perhaps the damage isn't as bad as I'm imagining. Maybe the owner has insurance that will cover the damages. There's even the chance that the owner might be understanding and accept an apology without requiring financial compensation. It could also become an opportunity for me to learn and grow, becoming a more cautious driver in the future. There is more than one potential outcome here. My initial reaction may have been fear and worry, but taking a moment to analyze the situation gives me the realization that not everything is negative."
146,all-or-nothing thinking,I was on a coffee break and my boss reminded me of work that needs to get done. And I think I could get fired.,"It could be that my boss was just reminding me of my responsibilities and not threatening to fire me. Perhaps they were just ensuring the workflow is going smoothly. They might have mentioned the pending work because they are relying on me due to my efficiency and skills. It's also possible that my boss wants to see me succeed and advance in my career, not to dismiss me from the job."
147,mind reading,I was on a coffee break and my boss reminded me of work that needs to get done. And I think My boss must think I'm lazy.,"My boss might be worried about the deadline and wants to ensure that all tasks are completed in time. Perhaps my superior noticed I was taking a break and remembered to tell me about the pending task. It might not be a reflection of their perception of my work ethics but rather, simply a matter of timing or ensuring efficiency in the work process."
148,should statements,I was on a date and started to cough badly as the food was too hot And I think I should have ordered a milder dish,"It's possible that my coughing had less to do with the spiciness of the dish and more to do with something else - maybe I had a tickle in my throat, or maybe there was a little dust or scent in the air that irritated my lungs. It could also be that the spiciness simply caught me by surprise and it's not something I'm typically sensitive to. If I had truly wanted the dish, I shouldn't regret ordering it, as it was an innocent mistake. And who knows, maybe my date found my reaction to a spicy dish funny or endearing. I could have also used this as an opportunity to lighten the mood and laugh at myself."
149,labeling,I was on the phone with my boyfriend and he got a call on the other line. I assumed it was another girl calling him. And I think I am not good enough.,"The incoming call on my boyfriend's line could have been from anyone; a friend, a family member, his boss, or even a telemarketer. My automatic assumption that it was another girl reflects my own insecurity. I need to build my self-esteem and trust in the relationship. There is also a possibility that he might be planning a surprise for me or dealing with a personal matter that he isn't ready to discuss. My worth is not determined by my boyfriend's actions, rather it is something inherent in myself. I should talk to him openly about my feelings instead of internally amplifying my insecurities."
150,personalizing,"I was passed over for a new job with a larger company. And I think I had the qualifications and the experience for this job, yet I was passed over for someone else who had less experience than I.","Being passed over for a job I thought that I was well-qualified for doesn't have to mean something negative about me. There could have been numerous reasons why another candidate was chosen and they could be unrelated to my skills, experiences or qualifications. For example, the other person might have had a personal connection within the company, or the hiring manager may have felt that their personality was a better fit for the team. Maybe the company was looking for a mix of experience levels within the department and, for contrast, wanted someone with less experience. Or maybe this job wasn't the right path for me and there are better opportunities on the horizon. This rejection could be a chance for me to reflect and reevaluate my career goals to ensure they align with my passions and strengths."
151,personalizing,"I was passed over for a small promotion at my place of work. The person who got the promotion was younger and less experienced than me, but a favorite of the boss. And I think I was angry because I was the better person for the job.","Although I didn't get the promotion this time, it's possible my boss had reasons beyond favoritism, which I might not know about. Maybe the younger, less experienced colleague showed promising potential, or perhaps it was a strategic move for the team's dynamic that I don't fully understand. It could also be that they believe I excel in my current position and I'm needed there more. Moreover, perhaps this encountered hurdle is an opportunity in disguise for me to reevaluate my career goals, satisfaction levels, seek feedback for improvements, consider the worth of the job role or even explore opportunities outside my current workplace. I should see it more as a stepping stone than a setback."
152,"personalizing,all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion,overgeneralizing,blaming",I was planning a bachelor party for a friend and some of the people invited were not satisfied with what I was trying to plan. And I think Why can't they cooperate on this?,"Rather than viewing the lack of cooperation from some invitees as a personal slight or failure, I can consider a few alternatives. Perhaps these individuals have different expectations or ideas about what a bachelor party should look like based on their unique experiences. Maybe they are under stress or dealing with personal issues that are influencing their reactions. It could also be a simple misunderstanding, and they don't grasp what I am trying to plan. Considering these possibilities, I should foster open communication, ask for their opinions, and explain my ideas better. If all else fails, I should remember that I am doing this for my friend and focus on what he would enjoy, rather than trying to please everyone."
153,all-or-nothing thinking,I was reprimanded at work for standing up to a coworker who was bullying another co-worker. And I think It was unfair that I was the one to get in trouble for defending a weaker person.,"I was reprimanded at work for intervening in a situation with coworkers, which initially felt unfair to me. However, I can also consider the perspective that the management may have preferred to handle the issue independently, to maintain the professional dynamics in the workplace. My intervention could have been viewed as disruptive or unprofessional. Additionally, there's the possibility that my approach to standing up wasn't entirely appropriate, which could have contributed to me being reprimanded. Instead of letting this incident affect my self-esteem and perception of fairness, I can see it as a learning experience to improve my communication and conflict resolution skills in the future."
154,"mind reading,labeling,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,personalizing",I was talking to a friend who got me angry. And I think He's insulting me.,"It's possible that my friend didn't intend to insult me and what he said came out wrong. He might be having a rough day or be under a lot of stress, causing him to speak harshly. Alternatively, he might not have realized that his words could have upset me. Our communication could have been affected by our mood or the context of our conversation may also have been misinterpreted. Perhaps, I could have misunderstood his words or made assumptions about his intentions that are not true."
155,personalizing,I was talking to my husband about something that happened to me that day.  He kept interrupting and talking over me.  I got up and left the room. And I think My husband was being a jerk and not listening to me.,"My husband might be under stress and not necessarily trying to belittle my concerns. He might have been distracted by his own worries or simply have been in a bad mood at the time. Another possibility is that he was trying to provide a solution before fully understanding the situation, which is a common pattern of communication for some people. Alternatively, he might not be aware of his habit of interrupting, and it may be beneficial to have a conversation about this at a neutral time. So, instead of assuming he's being a jerk, I should consider these other possibilities and discuss the issue with him."
156,"overgeneralizing,personalizing,blaming",I was talking with my boyfriend on my lunch break and he started to clean his computer with canned air which made a very loud noise. And I think Does he not care what I am saying?,"He might not be aware that the noise from cleaning his computer is that loud on my end, maybe he thought his microphone wouldn't pick it up. There's also a possibility he didn't realize I'd find it disrespectful or he thought I wouldn't mind since I know he often multitasks. It's also possible that this was something urgent and he couldn't delay it. Instead of jumping to the conclusion that he doesn't care about what I am saying, I should communicate my feelings with him."
157,emotional reasoning,I was told that I don't look as attractive as I used to by my significant other. She told me that she does not like the way that I have been dressing lately and that I should go back to my old style of dressing. I can recall feeling embarrassed and let down with myself. I felt very tiny and as though my relationship was falling apart because she was starting to become very superficial. And I think What am I doing to deserve this?,"Perhaps my partner didn't mean to sound harsh but was just expressing her concerns. Maybe she misses the way I used to look not because she's superficial, but because it reminds her of our past happy moments. As some people are uncomfortable with changes, her comments might not necessarily indicate that our relationship is falling apart, but rather, she might be struggling to adapt to my changes. There is also a chance that I'm not genuinely comfortable with my new style and it reflects in my behavior, which might have provoked her response. Could it be a way for her to tell me that something is bothering her? Maybe it's not about what I did or didn't do, and it's more about demonstrating concern for each other. I could see this as an opportunity for open communication and discuss our concerns."
158,"labeling,all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion",I was unable to visit my Mother in the hospital in another state. And I think I am the worst daughter in the world.,"One possibility is that perhaps I am not the worst daughter, considering I have other responsibilities and duties that I can't neglect, such as a job, children or my health. It might not have been physically feasible for me to travel at this time. It's also possible that while my presence would have factored into my mother's well-being, there could be other ways of offering support, like frequent calls and emotionally investing in her. It could also mean that I am placing too much pressure and unrealistic expectations on myself which might be due to my tendency to overanalyze situations. Maybe I am the best daughter for doing everything I can given my circumstances."
159,"catastrophizing,overgeneralizing,negative feeling or emotion",I was up for a promotion at work and did not receive it. And I think I will be stuck in middle-management for the remainder of my career.,"Not getting the promotion may be a temporary setback and does not necessarily dictate my future career progression. There could be a variety of reasons that I didn't receive it such as budget restrictions, external hires or perhaps, I may need to further develop certain skills to qualify for a higher position. This experience can be viewed as an opportunity for feedback and growth, helping me to identify areas of improvement. Alternatively, this may also be a reason to consider other companies or fields that may value my skill sets more. As such, this situation does not mean I'm confined to a middle-management level forever."
160,catastrophizing,"I was walking in a poorly lit downtown area when a man approached me and asked for money. I told him I had none, and he started cussing me out and following me. I eventually started running and he finally stopped following. And I think He is going to hurt me","It's understandable that the encounter was a stressful one. However, it's also possible that the man was just desperate and frustrated but had no intention of causing me physical harm. I was able to successfully distance myself from him by running, and there is a chance that he gave up following because he didn't mean any harm. He might have reacted aggressively due to his own issues or circumstances, not necessarily because he intended to hurt me. It's also a good reminder for me to avoid poorly lit areas after dark, or to consider carrying personal safety devices or learning some form of self-defense for my peace of mind."
161,"negative feeling or emotion,blaming",I was with friends and misinterpreted a comment and was upset for the wrong reasons. Turns out I misheard what was said and made a big deal out of nothing. And I think Why are my friends treating me so harshly?,"Perhaps my friends aren't actually treating me harshly, but I'm sensing harshness due to my own insecurities or stress. There might be instances where I misunderstand or misinterpret their comments because of my current emotional state. It could also be possible that my reaction was not about this incident specifically, but rather a response to underlying issues that I've been suppressing. Maybe I miscommunicated my feelings to my friends, and they are unaware of how I truly feel. Or possibly, I could be projecting my own judgement of myself onto them, thus perceiving their comments as hurtful when they may not be."
162,labeling,I wave to an acquaintance and get no response. And I think I don't make a memorable impression on people.,"Perhaps the acquaintance was deep in their thoughts and didn't notice or they may have been having a bad day and therefore not as friendly as usual. Maybe they didn't see me. It could also be that they have poor eyesight and simply didn't recognize me. It's possible that they were in a rush, or on the phone, and didn't want to be rude by interrupting their task. These possibilities show that I shouldn't jump to the conclusion that this incident means I fail to make a memorable impression on people."
163,should statements,I went on a trip and heard a commercial for a kitchen appliance And I think I feel so anxious maybe I left something turned on in the kitchen,"It's possible that I'm feeling anxious because I've been under a lot of stress and the commercial just brought it to surface. The commercial might have triggered a memory from the past where I forgot to turn something off and caused a problem. Or it could be that I left something on back home, but it might also be just a random thought. The commercial might also have made me realize that I want that particular kitchen appliance and suddenly aware of what I lack. It could also have reminded me of someone who could have used it and can't anymore due to an illness or accident. The anxiety could also be related to the fact that I don't feel entirely comfortable about this trip, not specifically about the kitchen appliance. It's possible that I'm just imagining the worst possible scenario, while reality is far from it."
164,negative feeling or emotion,I worried about being late and I almost crashed the car And I think I worry too much,"While I did rush myself and almost had an accident because I was late, it could have been a one-time incident due to other stressors in my life and not necessarily because I worry too much. Perhaps, I need to practice better time management to avoid such situations in the future. Maybe the underlying problem isn't chronic worry, but a habit of procrastination or poor planning that I need to address. I can also consider using calming techniques and being more focused while driving. Plus, maybe I am interpreting worry as a strictly negative trait, but it might also mean that I am responsible and committed to my commitments."
165,fortune telling,I yelled at my child for being too fidgety during stories at bedtime. And I think The kids will never settle down.,"Maybe my child is having a hard time settling down because they're overtired or overstimulated from the day. Perhaps I need to adjust our routine to ensure they're getting sufficient physical activity and downtime before bed. I could also consider different forms of story-telling that might better hold their attention. It's also possible that they may simply have a shorter attention span due to their age. Overall, I need to remind myself that children aren't always capable of controlling their fidgeting, and that doesn't necessarily mean they will never learn to settle down. It's just a learning process."
166,"all-or-nothing thinking,catastrophizing,blaming",I yelled at my sister for not doing something correctly And I think There will never be enough time to get everything done,"I may have acted out of frustration and yelled at my sister, but that does not make me a bad person. Everyone has moments of impatience. Maybe I was stressed out and felt overwhelmed. Instead of focusing on what I perceive is not being done correctly, I could support my sister, try to teach her, or appreciate her effort. In terms of deadline pressure, perhaps I need to better manage my time, delegate tasks, or prioritize what truly needs to be done. It's also okay to realize that we can't do everything perfectly and sometimes, good enough is sufficient."
167,emotional reasoning,I'm afraid of pregnancy and I think i'm not mentally or emotionally prepared And I think I can't be a mother,"While it's true that I'm not currently ready to become a mother due to my fears of pregnancy, it could potentially change in the future once I undergo proper therapy and counselling. It's also possible that these fears stem from underlying issues that I'm unaware of, which could be addressed with professional help. Perhaps, there's a chance that I might find other ways of having a family that align better with my mental and emotional readiness, like adoption or fostering. Maybe, I might not even choose to be a mother, and that could be a valid and satisfying life choice too."
168,labeling,"I'm facing an issue, that I love you girlfriend and she loves me back. But I hurt her because I'm manipulative, without really realizing what I'm doing. I make her feel guilty of things that she shouldn't feel so, and if I don't get things my way, I manipulate it so it sounds like it's her fault or she is wrong. I don't do it voluntarily, but I do it too often and it hurts her and me. And I think I am manipulative","While I recognize that I've been manipulative in my relationship, I want to accept responsibility and change for the better. It's painful to realize this about myself, especially knowing that I've caused harm. Perhaps I am being manipulative because I feel insecure in the relationship, or maybe it's a defense mechanism from past experiences. I need to explore why I act this way and learn healthier ways to manage issues in my relationship. Maybe it's not entirely about guilt or fault, but about communication and understanding. Possibly, if I approach situations more openly, with empathy, and commit to practicing positive communication habits, I can change my patterns and build a stronger relationship with my girlfriend."
169,comparing and despairing,I'm failing school And I think I'm worthless,"I may be facing difficulties in my current academic situation, but that does not necessarily indicate my complete worth. Everyone encounters challenges and setbacks from time to time. Maybe, I need to seek assistance on my course material, improve my study strategies, or manage my time more effectively. My academic performance is just one aspect of who I am and does not define my entire value as a person. I have other abilities and strengths that I can be proud of. Self-worth is not dependent on academic success alone."
170,negative feeling or emotion,I'm feeling suicidal And I think I can't stop cutting myself,"While it is true that right now I'm experiencing strong negative emotions and feel an overwhelming urge to harm myself, there may be alternative coping mechanisms I haven't explored yet. Possibly, there might be activities or therapies that could help me manage these feelings, like art therapy, journaling, exercise, or mindfulness meditation. Lastly, although this seems unbearable right now, it could also be helpful to remember that emotions fluctuate and what I'm feeling now is not a permanent state. The fact that I'm consulting a psychologist is already a step forward in seeking help and change."
171,labeling,"I'm hanging out with a friend chit chatting, but realizing he's not putting much effort, like usual, into having good conversation.  He just repeats the same thing ad nauseam. And I think He's a nice guy, but I don't want to be friends with him any more as he's putting no effort into not being completely boring.","While it's true that my friend tends to repeat the same things and doesn't put a lot of effort into our conversations, it's also possible that he is comfortable with me and feels no need to impress me with varied and exciting conversation. Maybe he has limited social skills, or he's just not as adept at small talk. Perhaps he's going through a tough time and can't concentrate on our conversation, or he's introverted and doesn't talk a lot by nature. Alternatively, he could be fundamentally a good listener rather than a talker. Before I decide to end our friendship, maybe I should engage him on this issue and express how I'm feeling. It's also worthwhile to remember the valuable aspects of our friendship that extend beyond stimulating conversation."
172,overgeneralizing,I'm late for the meeting And I think I never do anything right,"While it's true that I was late for the meeting, it doesn't necessarily mean I never do anything right. There might be situations where I didn't succeed as expected, but there are also plenty of instances where I have done well. For instance, I’ve completed projects successfully and received good feedback. It's important to remember that nobody is perfect and everyone can make mistakes, being late for a meeting doesn't negate all my previous accomplishments. It's just one event, not a reflection of my overall performance or character."
173,labeling,I'm late for the meeting And I think This shows what a jerk I am,"Being late for the meeting doesn't necessarily define my entire personality. It might have happened due to uncontrollable circumstances or poor time management on my part this time. Rather than labeling myself as a jerk, I could view this as a learning opportunity to improve my punctuality in the future. I can apologize for my tardiness and put in place a plan to prevent such incidents from happening again. It's more constructive to see this situation as an isolated incident rather than letting it define my entire personality."
174,all-or-nothing thinking,I'm waiting everyday for the weekend and the holidays. I'm not getting anything productive done. And I think I can't bring myself to be motivated.,"While it's true that I am excited about weekends and holidays, maybe that's because I've not found a proper work-life balance. Instead of focusing on this perceived lack of productivity, I could try to identify elements of my work that I enjoy and find fulfilling, and reorient my attention towards these aspects. This might help me feel more motivated throughout the week. It's also possible that I'm overwhelmed and simply need some rest or a change in my routine, rather than feeling obliged to be productive all the time. Developing new hobbies or interests could also provide a surge of energy and motivation. Additionally, speaking with other friends or colleagues about their experiences and coping mechanisms might provide me with new perspectives. Breaking down large goals into smaller, achievable tasks might also increase my motivation."
175,"labeling,all-or-nothing thinking",I've been a massive bummer in my personal life and am making people feel bad And I think I'm worthless,"I've been experiencing some struggles in my personal life which are impacting my mood and affecting the way I interact with others. These are also leading me to question my own self-worth. However, I am aware that everyone goes through tough times and we all have our ups and downs. Perhaps, the people around me understand this and offer me their support rather than feeling bad about my situation. Also, it could be that I am being too hard on myself and not recognizing my positive contributions and qualities. This visit to the psychologist might actually be a very sensible step in the right direction, showing my strength and desire to overcome these negative feelings and improve my life."
176,catastrophizing,I've been applying for jobs and just got a call that someone else filled a position I applied for. And I think I might never get hired.,"I didn't get the job I applied for, but that doesn't mean I won't get hired in the future. This experience could provide me an opportunity to review and improve my application materials and interview skills. Every rejection can be a learning experience and brings me closer to the job that's right for me. I still have many opportunities ahead of me and should not let this affect my self-worth or deter me from applying for other jobs. I may not have gotten this job, but the right job for me could be just around the corner."
177,catastrophizing,I've been sitting at my desk for a long time and I haven't been able to get anything done. And I think I will lose my job eventually.,"There could be numerous reasons why I am struggling to get work done - it might be due to stress, anxiety, burnout, or lack of motivation, which is natural yet temporary. My performance at work could improve if I take short regular breaks, implement time-management techniques, and try to focus on single tasks rather than multitasking. My concerns about potentially losing my job may stem from my own insecurities and might not be based on my actual performance. Speaking to my superiors about my work performance could provide clarity, and their feedback might actually be positive. Additionally, seeking professional help through this period of stagnation and seeming underperformance will likely improve my mental wellbeing and consequentially, my job performance."
178,comparing and despairing,I've been sitting at my desk for a long time and I haven't been able to get anything done. And I think Other people are probably doing it better than me.,"It's true that I have been sitting at my desk for a long time without accomplishing much. This could potentially be a sign that I need to change my work habits, maybe incorporating more breaks or switching tasks more frequently to keep myself engaged. Alternatively, it could be indicating a lack of motivation or dedication to my current tasks, in which case I need to either find ways to rekindle the passion or consider a potential shift in career. Comparing myself to others isn't beneficial as everyone works differently. Some people may indeed be more efficient at their work but they have had their own share of struggles too. Remembering that everyone goes through ups and downs helps validate my own experience. What's most important is learning and growing from these difficulties rather than allowing them to make me feel inadequate."
179,"overgeneralizing,personalizing",I've mentioned being sad and no one seems to think its anything serious And I think No one cares about me,"Perhaps, people around me are not perceiving my sadness as I anticipate because they might not completely understand how I am feeling internally or they may not be equipped with emotional sensitivity. Rather than taking it as apathy towards me, it could also mean that they see resilience in me and believe that I am capable of overcoming my emotion. Or it's possible that my expressions are so subtle that people just cannot notice them. Moreover, seeking help from professional psychologists is a proactive step where I am actively looking after my mental health than relying on others to understand my feelings."
180,labeling,In class I feel like others hear my thoughts and judge me. When some things really don't work(for example I have some things for school for tommorow and I can't find how to do that thing after searching hours on internet I get angry and sometimes results to self harm(punching). I sometimes feel like everybody is here just to watch me and see how I react to things(sounds insane). And I think Am I insane?,"In class, I sometimes feel conspicuous, like my thoughts and insecurities are on display. Stress management is challenging for me — research for school, in particular, can lead to bouts of frustration and anger that I sometimes misdirect towards self-harm. I feel overwhelmed by the sensation that people are constantly scrutinizing my reactions and feelings, making me question my mental stability. But, perhaps I might be misinterpreting their curiosity or concern as judgment. It's likely that they're also occupied with their own thoughts and insecurities. My emotions might be heightened due to the academic pressure I'm under, and perhaps I need to learn better coping mechanisms for these frustrations rather than resorting to self-harm."
181,negative feeling or emotion,It's so hard to study effectively and it takes all the time and energy I have. And then I still don't feel prepared. And I think I'm so behind and i'm so afraid of the terrible grades I will recieve. I can't do anything right,"While it's true that studying consumes valuable time and energy, perhaps some new strategies might make it more manageable. Instead of worrying about being ill-prepared or falling behind, I could schedule short, focused study periods that seem less daunting, followed by rejuvenating breaks. Instead of focusing on potential poor grades, I should remind myself why I am studying in the first place. I'm learning new things which can help me in my future career. Maybe I'm not perfect, but no one is, and the important thing is that I'm making an effort and doing my best. Improvement is possible, as long as I believe I can achieve it and I don't give up on myself."
182,emotional reasoning,I’m a drug addict And I think I feel like I will never be loved in a romantic way because I am not very pretty,"I may struggle with substance abuse, but I do understand that my challenges don't define me or my potential for love. Physical appearances are subjective and beauty is not the sole determinant of love. Love is a profound, multi-faceted experience that involves understanding, compassion, mutual respect, and shared values. It's possible that someone may not love me for my looks but for my character, kindness, resilience, or even the fact that I'm seeking help to overcome my struggle. Furthermore, I should focus on self-love and recovery first which could pave a way for healthier relationships in the future."
183,catastrophizing,Last week I found out that my mother had experienced sudden back pain that lasted for a few days  and I somehow worked myself into a very concerned state where I kind of felt like she was going to become completely incapacitated and have to live in a nursing home. And I think I'm afraid she's going to die soon.,"Just because my mother had this sudden experience of back pain doesn't automatically mean the worst is to come. Many people, especially as they age, experience sporadic pain that can be effectively managed with medical help. It's possible that her pain can be successfully treated or even just a one-time occurrence. It's also important to remember that everyone ages and death is a part of life. It's natural to fear losing loved ones, but we cannot let this fear overtake our daily life. Dwelling on these fears not only affect me, but also my interaction with her, and I don't want our relationship clouded by negative emotions. It would be more beneficial to focus on spending quality time with her in the here and now, and to discuss and plan for the future responsibly and calmly, without panic."
184,"disqualifying the positive,negative feeling or emotion,magnification",Last week I made a special dinner at my house for my family to enjoy but I overcooked the food. And I think after 30 years since I first started learning how to cook I am still ruining meals.,"While it's true that I overcooked the dinner last week, it doesn't mean I'm a bad cook or that I haven't improved over the last 30 years. Cooking involves a lot of variables and even professional chefs make mistakes. Maybe I was distracted while preparing this meal or maybe there was a problem with the recipe. It's also possible that my family didn't mind the overcooked food as much as I did. They might have appreciated the effort I put into making a special dinner. Even though I made a mistake this time, it doesn't mean I always ruin meals. I can try again next time, perhaps with a simpler recipe or by paying more attention to the cooking process."
185,"labeling,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,overgeneralizing",Last week I talked to a girl at a bar but was rejected by her And I think I am undesirable,"Last week, I attempted to start a conversation with a girl at a bar, and despite her disinterest, there are many reasons that this could have occurred beyond my perceived desirability. She could have been preoccupied, already dating someone, or simply not in the mood to socialize. It's also possible that we didn't share enough common interests or she was not attracted to me, which has more to do with individual compatibility than my overall worth or attractiveness. It's important to remember everyone experiences rejection from time to time and this is by no means a reflection of my overall ability to engage in meaningful relationships. Additionally, my desirability should not be determined by others, but based on my self-esteem, personal accomplishments, and values."
186,"mind reading,personalizing,overgeneralizing","Last week my sister and I facetime. I didnt show much interest. Later that day, my cousin told me that my sister was sad because of my behavior. And I think I made my sister sad","While I may feel guilty that my sister was sad, it's possible there were other factors contributing to her feelings other than my behavior. Maybe she was already having a bad day and my perceived indifference just added to it. Or perhaps she was upset for other reasons and misinterpreted my demeanor. It's also possible that my cousin misread or exaggerated her emotions. It's important to communicate directly with her to understand her feelings rather than assuming the worst about my actions. There could also be a good chance that she knows I didn't mean to hurt her feelings and she might forget about this incident soon. It's not completely my responsibility for how she feels. We all have days when we are not at our best."
187,"comparing and despairing,personalizing","Last week, my co-worker was invited to participate in a workshop and I was not. And I think My co-worker is better than me.","It's possible that my co-worker was invited to that particular workshop because it aligns better with their skill set or job responsibilities. The selection may not be a reflection of who is better overall, but who's the best fit for the workshop. It's also possible that invitations were randomly distributed or alternatively, perhaps my co-worker is showing more interest in these activities, which makes them more noticeable for these opportunities. I should focus more on my professional growth and showing interest in participating in similar activities if I want to be selected next time."
188,emotional reasoning,Lost best friend murdered this time of year in 2017. And I think My parents are judging me,"Though it's a devastating experience to go through the loss of a best friend, it's crucial to remember that it's not my fault and it's normal to feel grief. Everyone has their unique coping mechanisms and time it takes to heal. As for my parents, it may appear like they are judging me, but it's also possible they're just concerned and unsure how to help. They might be acting differently because they can't relate or understand my feelings well. Maybe they are just frightened to see me in this state. There's also a possibility that I'm misinterpreting their actions. Open communication could clarify these issues, and professional help can further assist me in processing my emotions about the loss and my relationship with my parents."
189,fortune telling,"Meeting an old friend, that I hadn't seen in 21 years for lunch. And I think what if i have nothing to say, what if we don't click anymore, what if this goes badly.","Instead of fearing awkwardness or that we may not get along, I can consider this meeting as an opportunity to reconnect and catch up on each other's lives. Even if we have changed over the years, we can celebrate our growth and maybe support each other in new ways. What if we still share the same interests? What if this lunch helps us revive our friendship? And what if instead of a disaster, this ends up being one of the best days I've had in years because of pleasant nostalgia?"
190,catastrophizing,My Dentist told me I'd need a root canal procedure. And I think I'm going to have to endure some physical and financial pain.,"While it's true that my dentist said that I need a root canal procedure, I may not necessarily have to experience extreme physical pain. Anesthesia or sedation are options to manage this. In terms of financial concerns, I could potentially protect my financial health by discussing payment plans with the dental clinic, exploring dental insurance options, or seeking help from a dental school where the costs might be lesser. Alternatively, I could also consider getting a second opinion to ensure that the suggested procedure is the best course of action for my situation."
191,emotional reasoning,My boss interrupted my break to tell me to work And I think I feel guilty,"It might not be entirely my fault for feeling this way. Breaks are designated for employees to rest and it is healthy and completely normal to value that time. Maybe my boss didn't realize that I was on my break, or maybe there is an overflow of work, making it tough to respect break times. It's also possible I didn't communicate clearly enough about when my break was, leading to this confusion. This incident heightens my emotional senses which affects my perception. It might be helpful to set clear boundaries and communicate more openly with my boss moving forward."
192,negative feeling or emotion,My boss on the construction site was very mean and aggressive with me. And I think I must not have been doing a good job,"It's possible that my boss was having a bad day, which made him act in an aggressive manner or he might be under some stress and unfortunately took it out on me. Alternatively, he might just have a gruff manner or poor people skills. It could also be a communication issue where my boss didn't clearly express his expectations or gave unclear instructions. It doesn't necessarily mean that I am not doing a good job. In fact, I have been praised by other colleagues for my work, so there's a likelihood that the issue lies more with my boss than with my work performance.
"
193,all-or-nothing thinking,My boss pointed out an unintentional error in my work And I think This work is a failure,"Apart from thinking that this work is a failure because of my boss pointing out an unintentional error, I could also consider that this is an opportunity for growth and learning. It's possible that the mistake was due to a skill or knowledge gap that I can now work on improving. My boss may have pointed it out not because I am incompetent, but because they believe in my potential and want me to do better next time. Alternatively, it could be a small error that does not define the overall value of my work. The error could also be a result of circumstances external to my control."
194,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling",My boss pointed out an unintentional error in my work. And I think I am incapable of doing anything right.,"Although my boss pointed out unintentional error in my work, it could signify that he wants me to improve in my job rather than considering me incapable. This incident can also be perceived as a chance to learn and grow from mistakes. It could also mean that my boss trusts me enough to provide feedback which could help me in my career growth. This error could indeed be an isolated case that happened due to unforeseen circumstances, and it doesn't define my overall competency or performance at work. Plus, everyone makes mistakes at some point, it’s a normal aspect of any workplace, and not exclusive to me."
195,negative feeling or emotion,My boss yelled at me And I think I'm feeling sad,"My boss raised his voice at me, which initially made me feel upset. However, it’s possible that he might have been having a rough day, or maybe it was just a miscommunication. Maybe he wasn't yelling at me because I did something wrong, but would have reacted the same way to anyone due to his own stresses. Rather than feeling sad, I can try to empathize with his situation, confront him about it, or focus on improving my work and communication, turning the experience into a growth opportunity. Since everyone has bad days, this incident doesn’t necessarily define my capabilities or myself as a person."
196,negative feeling or emotion,My boyfriend and I were supposed to go out last night and I got very aggravated at the change of plans and that he pushed back the time. And I think he didn't respect our initial commitment,"Perhaps there were emergency circumstances that demanded his attention and that he couldn't ignore it. It's possible he had a legitimate reason for changing plans which he may have not communicated clearly. By pushing back the time, he possibly was trying to juggle unexpected circumstances while also trying to fulfill his commitment to me. Maybe I should communicate clearly how I felt about the sudden change of plans and consider his point of view on the issue. I think it's important to not jump to conclusions about his intentions so quickly."
197,fortune telling,"My boyfriend didn't reply back to me instantly. And I think If I text my boyfriend too much, he will get bored of me.","It's possible that my boyfriend is just busy at the moment and couldn't respond immediately. He could be at work, stuck in a meeting, or spending time on a hobby. Maybe he doesn't feel the need to reply instantly all the time and it doesn't mean he is bored of me. I should stop thinking that frequent texting will bore him. Perhaps, he actually enjoys our interaction and it's just the frantic pace of today's life that delays his replies. Additionally, maybe we need to discuss and set expectations for communication to eliminate any misunderstanding."
198,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling",My boyfriend made fun of me for losing a game. I got upset and we had an argument. And I think I'm really bad at everything I do.,"While it's true that my boyfriend mocked me for losing a game, this doesn't imply I am bad at everything. Perhaps, he was simply in a teasing mood, and it was more about him than me. I let his words affect me and we had an argument. However, there could be numerous other reasons why I was upset. It might be possible I am feeling overly sensitive or stressed due to other situations in my life. And it also could be viewed as an opportunity to discuss with him about how such comments affect me, thereby improving our communication. So, instead of generalizing this one incident, I need to consider a broader perspective and remember instances where I've done well."
199,none,My boyfriend told me that I shouldn't clean the bathroom and to go and deal with the kids. And I think He doesn't think that I'm capable of watching the kids and cleaning the kitchen at the same time.,"Perhaps my boyfriend saw that I was overwhelmed and wanted to help me manage my tasks better. He might have seen that the kids needed immediate attention and suggested I focus on them first while he could tackle the cleaning. Alternatively, he could have thought that I deserved some rest and wanted to share the chores. His remark could also be his way of expressing his concern about my stress levels and his desire for me to take things slowly. His intention might not be to undermine my capabilities, but rather his aim could be to provide me with support."
200,mind reading,My boyfriend went to visit his son and wound up spending the entire day with his son and his son's mother while ignoring my phone calls. And I think I thought he was cheating on me,"There could be many reasons why my boyfriend spent the entire day with his son and his ex-wife. It's possible they were discussing issues related to their child's care or education. His neglect of my phone calls could be due to him being engaged in deep conversation or a busy environment, and not necessarily that he was ignoring me intentionally. Instead of jumping to the conclusion that he was cheating, I could have a conversation with him about how his actions made me feel, and discuss ways to improve our communication in the future."
201,negative feeling or emotion,"My brother and I have been really getting into a lot of fights. This past weekend he blew up again because he thought I was talking over him, but he does it all the time to me. I was upset because of his temper tantrums again, it has been happening too much over the past few or more years. He is supposed to act like an adult now and he isn't. I can't really talk to him anymore because I fear that he will explode, although he does t anyways. And I think I am so angry that he is such a hypocrite. He doesn't realize he is guilty of the same things he explodes about.","It's possible that my brother's reactions aren't only a reflection of his immaturity, but maybe he's dealing with things emotionally or mentally that he's unable to express. Perhaps, his outbursts are a cry for help or an outlet for other issues he's struggling with in his life. It's also possible he's not fully aware of his own behavior and how it mirrors what he accuses me of. Instead of avoiding conversation with him, maybe we need a mediator or family therapy to productively work through our issues. Alternatively, my frustration and anger may be adding fuel to the fire. I should consider practicing more patience and understanding when interacting with him. It's worth considering, maybe this situation isn't just black and white, and there's room for improvement on both ends."
202,all-or-nothing thinking,My crush doesn't like me back And I think Never finding love,"It's possible that my crush isn't the right person for me and there are other people out there who would be a better match. It's also possible that my crush's perceptions of me aren't accurate or complete. This one rejection may just be temporary and doesn't mean that I'm unlovable or destined for solitude. In fact, it could provide an opportunity for me to learn and grow, improve my communication skills, and find better ways to express my feelings. There's a chance that I might meet someone else who's a better fit for me, and with whom I might build a stronger and more meaningful relationship. This situation also allows me to invest more in self-care and self-love, which are fundamental in building a healthy relationship in the future."
203,"negative feeling or emotion,magnification",My dad is in the next room in his hospice bed and im afraid of not doing everything right. And I think Am I doing enough,"While it's natural to feel anxious and fearful about my dad's condition and questioning if I'm doing enough, other possibilities to consider are appreciating the time that we still have together and focusing on providing him the best environment possible. Another perspective might be to recognize that while doing my best is expected, it's out of my control to manage his situation completely or perfectly, as I am not a professional healthcare worker. I can also seek help and support from hospice staff or a caregiver support group to share my feelings, and understand that it's okay to feel this way. Furthermore, I can remind myself that my presence and love for my dad matter the most."
204,overgeneralizing,My daughter lied to me about a photo on her phone because she was embarrassed And I think she doesnt want to share things with me,"My daughter did lie to me about a photo on her phone, but maybe she was embarrassed about the situation and wasn't ready to talk about it. Maybe she was trying to protect me from something that she believes would hurt me. It could be a situation she's trying to figure out herself first before sharing it with anyone. Alternatively, it could be a part of her developing her own personal boundaries and independent identity. This doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't want to share things with me, but perhaps she needs to approach things at her own pace. It's also a possibility that she might be scared of my possible reaction, so it might be helpful if I reassure her that she can talk to me about anything without fear of judgment or punishment."
205,"overgeneralizing,catastrophizing","My daughter refused to do anything I instructed her to and embarrassed me greatly before guests I was hosting. And I think If I cannot control her now, I have lost her perhaps forever","My daughter is showing strong-willed behavior and defied my instructions during a social gathering, leading me to feel a sense of embarrassment and loss of control. However, this may be an indicator that she is growing up and developing her own personality and ways of understanding the world, not necessarily means I am losing her forever. Her defiance may be a typical part of adolescent development or a cry for independence or even attention. Finding the root cause could potentially strengthen our bond, rather than estrange us. Also, it's useful to remember that one embarrassing incident does not define a lifetime relationship or predictive of future interactions."
206,blaming,My daughter spilled a drink on my desk. And I think She ruined my project,"My daughter accidentally spilled a drink on my desk, but it doesn't necessarily mean my entire project is ruined. Perhaps some parts of it got wet, but I might be able to recreate those sections or find digital versions. Maybe this is a signal that I need to pay more attention to her or take more breaks. This also presents an opportunity to have a conversation about carefulness around important work materials and could serve as an important learning experience for her. Additionally, I can use this event as an impetus to develop a more organized work system that will protect my work in the future from such incidents."
207,negative feeling or emotion,My daughter's illness And I think worry about a disabled family member,"It's absolutely normal to worry about a sick or disabled family member. But my constant worrying might indicate an anxiety issue that needs to be addressed. Perhaps, rather than obsessing over what cannot be changed, I could find ways to positively contribute to my daughter's well-being and adapt the home environment to more easily support a disabled individual. Simultaneously, I should also prioritize my own mental health, possibly seeking support through a local group of parents dealing with similar issues, or through individual or family counseling. I can also explore stress-management strategies like exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques."
208,emotional reasoning,My diet is not working And I think I feel like a failure,"It's worth considering that diets can be tricky and don't always work for a multitude of reasons, ranging from genetic factors, metabolic rate or even due to the type of diet. Rather than viewing this as a personal failure, perhaps it's an opportunity to reassess my health strategy. It could be that my body responds better to a different diet or that exercise is the missing key. In addition to shedding pounds, my focus could be more on feeling better, gaining energy and improving my health, which are all success in their own rights."
209,fortune telling,My father was being abusive to me And I think I can't do anything right. I am a disappointment.,"While it's true that my father has been abusive towards me, there might be many other factors contributing to this behavior that are beyond my control. Perhaps he himself is dealing with unresolved issues or stress that causes him to act out abusively. It doesn't necessarily mean that I am inherently flawed or incapable of doing anything right. It's possible that I feel like a disappointment mainly because of the constant negative feedback. I need to remember there are instances where I have been successful and have done things right, even if they got overlooked. Moreover, my worth shouldn't be solely determined by another person's perception or behavior towards me. I can seek help, learn, and grow through this experience, ultimately improving my self-esteem and personal skills."
210,fortune telling,My financial situation is going out of hand And I think I'm worried about my future,"While it's true that my current financial situation is challenging, it doesn't mean the future will be as bleak too. There could be new opportunities for financial growth in the future that I have not considered yet. Perhaps finding ways to manage and budget my expenses, seeking additional income or even financial planning consultation might be helpful. It's also possible to seek help and advice from individuals who have gone through similar situations and successfully overcome them. Worries are natural, but it's essential to remember that situations can change."
211,fortune telling,My first boyfriend and I broke up a few years ago And I think My partner will leave me if my depression doesn't go away soon.,"While it's true that my first boyfriend and I broke up, it doesn't necessarily mean my current partner will do the same just because I'm dealing with depression. Everyone is different, and it's possible that my current partner might be more understanding and supportive of my mental health journey. Besides, I am taking steps to manage my depression, and I'm improving each day. I could also have an open-hearted conversation with my partner about my fears and insecurities, which could lead to them providing me with the reassurance and assistance that I need. Furthermore, I must remember that I am a unique individual with many other qualities, and my depression does not define my entire persona or my relationship."
212,"blaming,personalizing,negative feeling or emotion",My friend and I had made plans months ago to go to a basketball game. The day before the game he calls me and says he cant go because he forgot he made plans with his wife. I started yelling at him and told him these tickets were expensive and you promised me. I was really angry for cancelling last minute because he has done this in the past And I think I get upset when people cant keep there promises. The plans he made were not that critical. Why put me in a tough bind,"While it's understandable to feel disappointed and angry at my friend for cancelling our plans last minute, it's essential to remember that everyone can be forgetful or make mistakes. Perhaps he genuinely forgot about his plans with his wife. Instead of yelling and letting the anger take over, I can express my disappointment in a calm manner and propose a solution like him helping to find someone else who could use the ticket. It would also be a good idea to have a serious conversation about the habit of cancelling plans last minute. Maybe our schedules are not syncing as well as they did before, or perhaps there's a bigger underlying issue we might need to address.In the future, we can make sure to double-check our plans or perhaps even use a shared calendar to avoid similar incidents."
213,"disqualifying the positive,overgeneralizing","My friend and I were looking at apartments. His first choice for apartments was one that was too small for my life goals, as I could not set up an office in it. He wanted the better room in the apartment. And I think He only cares about himself.","Although it initially seems likes my friend is only thinking for himself, it might be possible that he is unaware of my ambitions and needs for a spacious apartment. His liking for the smaller apartment could be influenced by budget constraints, preference for cozy spaces or even close proximity to certain areas. Potentially, he’s voicing his preference for the better room due to past experiences with less favorable living conditions. It might be beneficial to communicate my needs clearly to him and come to a consensus or possibly look for other options or people to share an apartment with."
214,all-or-nothing thinking,"My friend asked for advice, but I was unable to provide it And I think I'm completely self-centered and thoughtless","While my friend asked for advice and I was unable to provide it, it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm self-centered or thoughtless. There could be many reasons why I struggled to give advice; perhaps it's a subject I'm not well-versed in, or I feel unqualified to speak because it's outside of my experiences. Instead of hurting my friend with unintended inputs, I chose to listen attentively, providing emotional support. Lack of advice doesn't equate with lack of care. Moreover, there's always a chance to learn more about the issue and come up with advice later on. Feeling self-centered for not immediately having an answer could also indicate that I care deeply about their well-being and want to provide the best possible help."
215,labeling,My friend asked for help and I denied And I think I'm self-centered,"It's entirely possible that I denied my friend's request for help because I was overwhelmed with my own issues and responsibilities at that time. I should not label myself as self-centered. Personal boundaries are important and it's okay to sometimes say 'no' when I'm not in a state to assist others. It's important for self-care which in turn helps me to be in a better position to help others when necessary. Instead of feeling guilty about this, I could try reaching out to them, explaining the reason I couldn't help at the time and offer some assistance now if I'm capable and willing."
216,mind reading,My friends invited me to go bowling this Saturday And I think I bet all my friends will be amazing at bowling apart from me,"It could be that my friends invited me to bowling because they enjoy my company, not because they expect me to be an expert at it. Maybe they're not as good as I imagine, or perhaps they are also beginners like me. Even if they are better bowlers, this could be a chance for me to learn some tips from them and improve. Ultimately, the main focus of the gathering could be about having fun and bonding rather than competition. And even if I don't do well in bowling, it doesn't define my worth or skills in other areas."
217,emotional reasoning,My girlfriend came home later than usual after work and didn't bother to call and let me know or answer the phone when I called to check on her. She acted like it was not big deal after she came home. And I think My girlfriend is hiding something from me.,"Perhaps my girlfriend had a work related emergency or her phone ran out of battery and she could not inform me. Maybe she was so distracted with her day that she forgot to check her phone. It's possible that she's simply independent and handles her own problems without burdening me unnecessarily. She might not perceive coming home late as a big issue. Maybe she's stressed out about something and is unaware of how her actions are affecting me. Or perhaps, she didn't realise I was so worried.  So, It's possible she's not hiding anything at all."
218,catastrophizing,My girlfriend is getting a new job in a distant city. And I think This is going to cause us to break up.,"My girlfriend getting a new job in a distant city can be a reason for us to grow together and not necessarily break up. We can use this as an opportunity to strengthen our communication skills, learn about ourselves in the process, and improve individually as well. There could be possibilities of planning regular visits or even making arrangements for a long-distance relationship. This situation might also force us to consider more serious steps, like moving in together or even thinking about marriage. Maybe this new job will be better for her career growth which will lead to personal fulfillment and happiness that will positively affect our relationship."
219,"fortune telling,catastrophizing,mind reading",My girlfriend said I was a taker when I said she did not emotionally support me before going to a movie last Saturday. And I think My girlfriend will leave me.,"Considering my girlfriend's comment, she might be upset or frustrated at the moment she said it. It's possible that she didn't understand the level of emotional support I required at that time. Communicating more effectively about our emotional needs could resolve such misunderstandings. Assuming she will leave me is an extreme conclusion based on a single incident. This thought could stem from insecurity or fear of abandonment, which might be more related to my personal issues rather than indicative of her intended actions. Let's have an open and honest conversation about our feelings and needs to understand and support each other better in the relationship."
220,"mind reading,personalizing",My girlfriend was distracted by other men at the gym. And I think I'm not attractive enough.,"My girlfriend looking at other men at the gym could have several other explanations. Maybe she is simply admiring their workout routines, or she could have been lost in thought and not paying attention to her surroundings at all. It's also possible that she feels secure in our relationship and doesn't feel the need to constantly focus on me. As for my attractiveness, it's worth remembering that attractiveness is highly subjective and isn't limited to physical traits. It could be my personality, sense of humor, kindness, or intelligence that she finds attractive about me. These qualities are not easily seen during a workout at the gym."
221,"mind reading,negative feeling or emotion,all-or-nothing thinking,overgeneralizing,labeling,fortune telling,personalizing",My girlfriend was ignoring me for a while. And I think She didn't like me anymore.,"There could be several other possibilities to why my girlfriend is ignoring me. She might be going through a rough patch in her personal or professional life that she doesn't want to discuss. She could be feeling overwhelmed with her responsibilities and may just need space to cope. She could also be busy with work or other chores, not necessarily indicating that she doesn't like me anymore. It is also possible that she has some fears or concerns about our relationship, which she finds difficult to articulate. Just because she is ignoring me now doesn't mean her feelings for me have changed. We could just be having a communication issue that we need to work through."
222,"overgeneralizing,personalizing","My girlfriend was sad that I wanted to go out with my friends, and started a fight. And I think Why can't I have fun? Why must I stay home all the time?","Maybe my girlfriend wants to spend more time with me because she values our relationship and misses me. Could her feeling sad be a sign of not getting enough quality time with me? Instead of seeing her reaction as an attempt to restrict my freedom, can I consider it a call for attention and affection? Are there ways to balance both, my leisure time with friends and quality time with her? Also, does going out really the only way to enjoy and have fun? Could I try home based hobbies or activities that we both enjoy?"
223,all-or-nothing thinking,"My girlfriend wasnt texting anyone, and did not get me anniversary present And I think I am scared my girlfriend is going to break up with me because I dont do much for her.","Perhaps my girlfriend is just occupied with something important at the moment that she forgot to text or buy an anniversary gift. Her actions may not necessarily reflect her feelings towards me. We've been through a lot together and these little hiccups don't necessarily mean that she wants to end our relationship. Also, if I feel like I'm not doing much for her, I can start showing her more appreciation and love to strengthen our bond. The most important thing is a clear communication about my feelings with my girlfriend. It could be the case, she might have a surprise planned for the anniversary later or she may have her own worries too."
224,"catastrophizing,fortune telling",My grandfather died one year ago And I think I am scared something bad will happen to the people I love,"While it's normal to fear losing loved ones after experiencing a significant loss like my grandfather's death, I am aware that this fear might be amplified due to my grief. It's also possible to view this concern as a reflection of how much I care for my loved ones. Instead of being paralyzed by fear, I could channel this into action by expressing my love and concern for my family and friends, and appreciating every moment with them. I understand the concept of mortality but it doesn't necessarily mean something bad will happen soon. This fear might also be a sign that I need to process my grandfather's death more thoroughly, possibly seeking professional help like therapy or grief counseling."
225,catastrophizing,My grandma died a few years ago and my aunt recently had major surgery. And I think I'm scared of losing loved ones,"While it is absolutely normal to fear loss, maybe pointing my thoughts and energies on the present can be beneficial. My aunt just had a major surgery, instead of worrying about losing her, I can focus on her recovery. My grandma may not be around, but her teachings and memories are ever alive. I could channel my fears into appreciation of the moments we shared and the lessons learnt. Perhaps, finding a support group can be a helpful tool to navigate this fear. My fear of losing loved ones could actually be transformed into a driving force that ensures I connect more meaningfully with them. My fear can also remind me that change and loss are inevitable parts of life, leading me to cherish my relationships even more."
226,all-or-nothing thinking,My guitar teacher told me I needed to correct my posture And I think I've been practicing but I'm not making any progress,"My guitar teacher pointed out that I need to work on my posture but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm not making progress. It could simply mean that there are still room for improvements and aspects of my technique that I need to strengthen. Maybe, I am improving in other areas like fretwork or strumming but these might be subtle or gradual improvements that are harder for me to recognize. Despite my current state, I am learning and every session makes me better than before. Although my progress might be slow, the important thing is that I'm still moving forward. It's also possible that I'm being too hard on myself and my teacher might have noticed improvements that I haven't. It could be productive to express my concerns about my perceived lack of progress to my teacher so we could address this issue and perhaps alter the teaching techniques or outline clear improvement indicators."
227,"negative feeling or emotion,overgeneralizing",My husband and his friends are always speaking Spanish in front of me and I cannot understand anything And I think they are saying things in front of me that they don't want me to know or understand,"My husband and his friends often converse in Spanish, a language I don't understand, which causes me some discomfort. But perhaps they are not seeking to exclude me intentionally. The language could merely be a form of comfort or a habit when they're together. Instead of feeling left out, I can use this opportunity to learn some Spanish. This can not only help me understand their conversation but it will also get me closer to their culture. Maybe they don't realize I feel left out, so having a conversation about how I feel could help too."
228,blaming,My husband asked me to make sure I cleaned the cutting board better. And I think I do so much around here and you are harping about the cutting board?,"Perhaps my husband is concerned about our health and hygiene and is not doubting my role in the household. He may just be expressing his concern in a way that seems critical to me. Alternatively, he might be stressed out about something else and his comment about the cutting board was an outlet for it. Maybe he appreciates all the work I do in the household but doesn't know how to express it properly. Or he isn't aware of all the tasks I do, hence is focusing only on the minor things. I should sit and talk to him about it to clarify my doubts and feelings."
229,"mind reading,overgeneralizing,catastrophizing",My husband cancelled our wedding anniversary dinner. And I think The thought that he does not care about me anymore.,"My husband cancelled our wedding anniversary dinner. While one possibility is that he doesn't care about me anymore, it's not the only explanation. He might be going through a stressful time at work and forgot about our dinner, or perhaps there was an unavoidable conflict he didn't get to explain. It could even be that he is secretly planning a surprise for our anniversary. I shouldn't jump into conclusions without discussing the matter with him."
230,catastrophizing,My husband did something for me" even if it's clear I didn't want it." And I think I don't know why I keep trying. I should just give up. Surrender. Sleep forever.,"While it's true that my husband's actions upset me, it may not necessarily mean that he doesn't care about my feelings. Possibly, he just misunderstood what I wanted. Instead of simply giving up, I should try to communicate my feelings more clearly, and suggest alternative ways he can express his love and care. Sleep would offer temporary relief, but addressing the issue directly may provide a more long-term solution."
231,"mind reading,overgeneralizing",My husband got two tickets to a Bruins game the other day and rather than asking me if I wanted to go with him he invited a friend. And I think My husband doesn't want to spend time with me.,"It could be that my husband thought I might not enjoy the Bruins game as much as his friend would. He might have wanted to share this experience with a friend who is also a huge fan. Alternatively, he may have been trying to strengthen his relationships with his friends, as it's essential for everyone to maintain a proper balance between their romantic, familial, and platonic relationships. He also might have believed that I would appreciate some time alone to relax or engage in some activities that I love."
232,negative feeling or emotion,"My husband wants a divorce, I've self isolated for years, my brother died And I think Worthlessness, abandonment, grief","Despite the devastating turns that my life has taken recently, there are still ways I can regain control and seek support. My husband's wish for a divorce is a painful reality, but it can also be a chance for self-discovery and independence. While I've isolated myself for years, I have the power to reconnect with friends and loved ones or find new social groups. Additionally, I can seek assistance from communities or professionals to handle my grief over my brother's death. My feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and grief are valid, but they aren't an unchangeable fate. I can use therapy, self-care routines, and new social connections to rebuild my self-esteem and find new pathways in my life."
233,disqualifying the positive,My inabilities cost me my job. And I think I would not find a job,"I may have lost my job due to some specific circumstances, but this does not reflect on my overall capabilities or ability to find another job. Instead of focusing on my perceived 'inabilities,' I can take this as an opportunity to improve on areas I might be lacking and better equip myself for future job opportunities. There is a vast job market out there, with different types of jobs suited for different abilities. With persistence and perseverance, it is likely that I will find a new job. For all I know, my next job might be more rewarding and fulfilling than my previous one."
234,catastrophizing,"My love is leaving, and there's no turning back. And I think What if I never see her again?","Perhaps my love leaving is a sign that there's something better waiting for me in the future. Connections and relationships are fluid entities, they come and they go. And even if I don't ever see her again, this experience has taught me what I want and don't want in a relationship thereby preparing me for a healthier one in the future. Moreover, with the world being so interconnected, chances are high that our paths might cross in the future. Even if they don't, I have memories to cherish and lessons to learn from our time spent together."
235,personalizing,My manager is giving more responsibilities to another co-worker. And I think I deserve more than the other co-worker to get more responsibilities.,"It's possible that my manager is giving more responsibilities to my coworker because they believe it aligns with her skill set, or she may need the challenge to further develop her skills. It's not necessarily a reflection on my work or capabilities. It's also possible that my manager has other plans for me that haven't been discussed. Perhaps, I can take initiative and ask for a meeting with them to discuss my career growth and performance. Alternatively, I could also focus on doing my current tasks well and proving that I can handle additional responsibilities. It could also be a good opportunity for me to learn from my coworker's experiences."
236,disqualifying the positive,My mom cooked me breakfast and the eggs which she knows i like over medium were over cooked. I became very upset. And I think frustration,"Apart from getting upset, I could have calmly explained to my mom how I prefer my eggs. I could also show gratitude towards her effort to make breakfast for me. By doing so, we could have a constructive conversation instead of a confrontation. Or I could take it as an opportunity to learn how to make my preferred breakfast, to add some self-reliance. Alternatively, I could think of it as a one-time mistake and not let it affect my mood as much. It's not everyday things don't go as we want them to. Thus, I should be more understanding towards my mom and also have a more optimistic approach in handling such trivial troubles that arise."
237,catastrophizing,My next door neighbors filed a complaint against us last week blaming our dogs for excessive barking And I think They are so wrong and I'm so pissed but I know I can't prove it and they will probably win because they won't ever admit it and I have to do something right NOW! or I might lose my dogs.,"While it's frustrating that my neighbors have lodged this complaint about my dogs, there may be steps I can take to resolve the issue without confrontation. I could look into local regulations or speak with other neighbors to see if they've noticed any excessive noise. Perhaps investing in bark control devices like training collars or seeking help from a professional dog trainer might help. I could also make an effort to talk to my neighbors peacefully, explaining how much my dogs mean to me and finding a compromise. Action doesn't have to be instantaneous; patience and calm reasoning could lead to better results."
238,overgeneralizing,My partner broke up with me and slept with someone else And I think No one cares about me,"While it's true that my partner broke up with me and chose to be with someone else, that does not necessarily imply that no one cares about me. This event is isolated and unique to my relationship with my partner, it doesn't reflect the entirety of my personal relationships. There are other individuals in my life - family, friends, colleagues who have shown care and concern for me. It's worth remembering that one person's actions do not have the right to define my worth or the way others see me. Rather than blaming myself and sinking into self-undermining thoughts, I can see this as an opportunity to evaluate what worked and what didn't in my past relationship, learn from it, and focus on personal growth and development. It's also a good time to reconnect with individuals who truly care for me and invest my time and energy in nurturing these relationships.
"
239,mind reading,My partner left me. And I think I did something wrong,"It's also possible that my partner decided to leave due to their personal issues that may have nothing to do with me. Maybe there is some other factor playing a role in the situation that I am unaware of. It could be that the relationship was not meant to be or it was not the right time in our lives. It might not be reflective of my actions or behavior, but rather their own personal journey and growth. It's important for me to remember that I can't control other people's decisions and actions, and it's not necessarily a reflection on me."
240,personalizing,"My partner was visiting her daughter, who was having surgery.  I got annoyed with her on the phone because she was being distracted. And I think I wanted her to pay attention and not interrupt me.","Perhaps I was too hasty in getting annoyed with my partner while she was with her daughter during a medical procedure. I could have been more understanding of her situation and multitasking. Maybe I was anxious myself which caused me to crave her undivided attention. Making this about my need for attention rather than putting it on her potentially distracted state may explain my feelings too. Possibly, I could communicate my feelings more clearly next time, expressing my need for more attention or understanding in such situations."
241,"all-or-nothing thinking,magnification","My relationship ended out of nowhere, constantly stressed about my job, i ever feel like be worth it to another person or to my friends unless they need something. And I think I don’t feel like I’m worth it.","Though my relationship ended abruptly, it could be an opportunity for self-growth and to establish stronger bonds in the future. It's normal to feel stressed about work, but I can take steps to manage this stress and perhaps seek a work environment that suits me better. While it's natural to want to feel needed, my worth is not determined by what I can provide for others but by my personal qualities, achievements, and the love I give and receive. Instead of giving others the power to determine my worth, I can work on self-love and finding worth within myself."
242,"all-or-nothing thinking,labeling,negative feeling or emotion",My sister asked my mother about me taking care of her cats instead of asking me directly. And I think I don't matter.,"My sister's decision to ask mom about me taking care of her cats could mean a variety of things. Perhaps she thought I was too busy and didn't want to burden me with the request directly, or maybe she was asking mom's opinion first. It could also be that she was trying to arrange it as a surprise or she simply forgot to ask me directly due to her own stresses. Maybe she feels more comfortable discussing such matters with mom first. Her action is not necessarily a reflection or measurement of my worth or importance."
243,"mind reading,negative feeling or emotion",My sister in law won't speak to me And I think My sister in law thinks I am worthless,"My sister-in-law won't speak to me, but there could be multiple reasons for this. She might just be going through a tough time herself, or maybe she is just not good at handling interpersonal relationships. She may also feel awkward or uncomfortable about something that I am not aware of. It doesn't necessarily mean she thinks I'm worthless. The situation might change with time or become clearer if I directly ask for her thoughts."
244,comparing and despairing,"My sister looking amazing and me looking heinous, people at school being toxic And I think I hate myself and im a fat pig","Considering my sister's physical attractiveness, I see myself less attractive right now, but this can change if I start working on my self-improvement. The environment at school is challenging, but I can find ways to navigate it better and may even seek help to deal with it more effectively. Currently, I may not feel great about myself and perceive my weight negatively, but I can start by loving and accepting myself as I am and then gradually work towards fitness if that's something I believe contributes to my wellbeing."
245,negative feeling or emotion,My sister put pictures of everyone but me on her holiday card And I think No one cares about me,"Perhaps my sister simply forgot to include a picture of me on her holiday card. She could have been busy with all the holiday preparations and it slipped her mind. Alternatively, she might have chosen the photos based on their quality or relevance to the event, and maybe didn't find a suitable one of me for the card. Also, the holiday card is just a small thing, and it doesn't necessarily reflect the degree of love and care from my family. They might have expressed their love and care towards me in a more direct and important way."
246,"labeling,overgeneralizing",My sister tried to commit suicide whilst at middle school And I think I was not a good enough sister,"While it's true that my sister attempted suicide during her middle school years, it's important to remember that her mental health issues might have stemmed from a variety of complex factors that are beyond my control as her sibling. I may hold feelings of guilt, but it's possible that I did my best under the circumstances given my own knowledge and capacity at the time. Instead of blaming myself, I can focus on learning more about mental health so I can better support her in the future. Moreover, I can also engage in therapy for personal healing and growth and encourage her to do the same."
247,labeling,My son threw a tantrum at an indoor playground and I had to carry him out kicking and screaming And I think I'm a bad mom,"My son's behavior at the playground could be due to many factors, not necessarily a reflection on my parenting. It's possible he was tired, overstimulated, or could simply be testing boundaries, all of which are normal behaviors for his age. Also, I stepped up and handled the situation by removing him from the playground when he wasn't behaving appropriately. Although it was embarrassing, I should remember that most parents have faced similar situations. This doesn't make me a bad mom but offers me a learning opportunity to better handle such situations in the future."
248,none,My spouse became verbally abusive with me. And I think He might hit me,"Despite feeling fearful due to my spouse's recent verbal abuse, I recognize that jumping immediately to the worst-case scenario of him physically abusing me in the future may not be productive. Instead, I could constructively approach this issue by considering other potential scenarios. Maybe he's under immense stress and is unwittingly lashing out, or it's possible he is unaware of the severity and impact of his words. It might be worthwhile to speak to him about my fears at a safe moment or seek mediation or counseling services to address these issues. Alternatively, it's also plausible that this behavior may not escalate further, but continues, it's essential that I've thought about my options for maintaining my personal safety, such as staying with friends or family temporarily or seeking help from local domestic violence services. It's also crucial to remember that it's not an inevitability that verbal abuse will escalate to physical abuse, but it's important to be prepared should this situation arise."
249,"labeling,all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion,overgeneralizing,mind reading,personalizing,catastrophizing",My spouse got a new gaming console and spends most of his free time playing video games. And I think I am not good enough for him.,"My spouse has found a new hobby in video gaming and enjoys spending his free time this way. This doesn't necessarily mean I'm not good enough for him. Instead, it might simply be a new interest he has taken up to unwind or relieve stress. I could try to understand the game he's into or find a shared hobby we both could enjoy. Communicating my feelings to him about his excessive gaming might also improve our relationship. He may not realize I feel neglected and his reassurance might alleviate my self-doubts."
250,emotional reasoning,"My teenage child wanted to go out with friends and I said no And I think I feel horrible about it, I must be a bad parent","My adolescent child expressed a desire to socialize with friends and I denied them this. Although I initially felt a wave of guilt wash over me, leading me to question my skills as a parent, I need to remember that I made this decision out of concern for their safety and well-being, not out of spite. There could be numerous valid reasons why I said no - maybe it was a school night, or there could be potential dangers associated with where they were going. It's also necessary for my child to learn about boundaries and the importance of abiding by rules. Rather than seeing myself as a bad parent, I could view this situation as an opportunity to communicate openly with my child about my worries and reason behind my decision."
251,mind reading,My uncle was in a serious accident and ignorant members of my family did not contact me and let me know. And I think The anger I felt because some members of the family do not like me so they refused to let me know about my beloved uncle.,"Perhaps my family was too overwhelmed dealing with the crisis at hand. They maybe thought that I would be deeply perturbed and would not be able to handle the situation emotionally, so they held back the news from me. It is also possible that they wanted to confirm what exactly happened to my uncle and get all the facts right before informing me. Instead of rushing to negative conclusions, I can ask them directly and at least clear my doubts about their intentions."
252,mind reading,My wife accused me of cheating. And I think She doesn't trust me.,"Perhaps my wife's accusations of me cheating are not solely about her lack of trust in me, but are indicative of other underlying issues in our relationship that aren't being addressed. Maybe she feels neglected or insecure about our relationship and is projecting those feelings onto me. It could also be that her thoughts are influenced by her past experiences or insecurities which have nothing to do with my current behaviors. It might be beneficial to consider these perspectives and engage in open communication with her to better understand her concerns."
253,all-or-nothing thinking,My wife didn't look up from her phone or answer me when I came to talk to her. And I think Am I not worth her time?,"Maybe my wife was caught up in something important at the moment - like reading an important email or message when I went to talk to her. Perhaps, she didn't hear me because she was too engrossed and it's not that she deliberately ignored me. It could also be that she was having a stressful day and wanted to zone out with some mindless scrolling. It doesn't necessarily imply that I'm not worth her time. I should communicate how I felt rather than making negative assumptions about her behavior."
254,catastrophizing,My wife has left me. And I think I'm going to be alone,"Even though my wife has left me, this doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to be alone forever. This could be an opportunity to discover myself anew and build healthier patterns and behaviors, being a better person overall. I could reconnect with old friends or make new ones. Maybe I could even find love again in the future. Solitude can be a chance to grow and gather strength. This could eventually lead me to a happier place."
255,mind reading,My wife sat me down and said she needed me to make more money because she is tired of paying rent by herself And I think i was letting her down and she felt pressured by my actions,"Perhaps my wife is simply feeling overwhelmed, not only financially but emotionally too. While it's true that she emphasized the financial aspect, she might also be longing for a sense of teamwork and equal contribution in the relationship. It's not necessarily that I am letting her down, but she may feel that she’s carrying an unfair share of our collective burdens. These burdens might not only be about money, but also about managing the house, emotional support, decision making and future planning. It's essential that I try to understand her perspective and make sure our roles are balanced in all aspects of our shared life. This situation could be an opportunity to improve our communication and grow as a couple."
256,"negative feeling or emotion,emotional reasoning,blaming","My wife, asked me very kindly, to finally clean the bathroom shower in our bathroom, and I got upset by this. And I think I'm busy doing something else, it's not like I haven't tried to get to that chore!","Perhaps my wife wasn't trying to criticize me, but just bringing up a task that needs to get done. I know my reaction was due more to my own stress and busyness rather than her request. She understands I'm busy but maybe she also needs help with the chores or there's something about the task she's uncomfortable with. Rather than getting upset, I could discuss with her and perhaps rearrange our chores or create a schedule for cleaning so that the responsibility doesn't fall heavily on one person. Taking some time to relax might also help me handle requests better."
257,"catastrophizing,fortune telling,magnification",No trust And I think I am scared something bad will happen to the people I love,"It's possible that my fear stems from past traumatic experiences or anxiety that isn't founded on realistic probabilities. This fear may be a protective mechanism but it could also be disrupting my daily life and peace of mind. Perhaps I could take steps to confront and overcome these fears, such as talking openly about them with the psychologist. There's a chance that the psychologist can provide me with techniques and strategies to manage and reduce these fears. I could also seek comfort in the fact that most fears are often worse in our thoughts than in reality, and knowing that every life involves risks might help put my worries into perspective."
258,labeling,Nobody finds me attractive other then my boyfriend And I think I am ugly,"While one of my thoughts is that only my boyfriend finds me attractive and I consider myself unattractive, there are other ways of understanding this. Perhaps I am typically surrounded by people who have different aesthetic standards. This does not automatically mean I am universally unattractive. Attraction is an extremely subjective concept that can vary greatly from person to person. My self-perception might also be skewed due to low self-esteem or other emotional distress. This does not necessarily reflect reality. Moreover, physical attractiveness is only one aspect of a person and does not determine the value or worth of an individual. My other qualities such as my kindness, intelligence, humor, and talents are equally critical, which can make me attractive to others."
259,personalizing,Once I was unemployed because I had many faults at work And I think Having done things wrong,"Even though I was unemployed due to some faults at my previous job, this situation can also be seen as a learning opportunity. All humans make mistakes and it's okay to make them as they hold lessons for the future. Perhaps I wasn't fit for the particular job role and environment, or maybe I needed to improve my skillset or time management. Being unemployed can give me the chance to reflect, seek training, research related fields, brush up my skills, and time to seek a job better suited for me. Basically, I shouldn't see this as a failure or personal fault, but rather, a chance to start anew and improve."
260,"negative feeling or emotion,comparing and despairing,all-or-nothing thinking",Our forest inventory data is due in less than three days and I still have over 100 plots to do.  The date cannot be missed and my superiors expect it completed. And I think I have at least four normal days of plot work needing done in three days,"Although the forest inventory data task is daunting, if I break it up into manageable parts, it might not seem so overwhelming. Instead of focusing on the 100 plots I have left, I could concentrate on completing as many as I can each day. It's important for me to remember that I can only do what my capacity allows. Perhaps, I could approach my superiors, asking for assistance or suggesting a different schedule that could make the completion of the task more feasible within this tight deadline. And even if the deadline isn't met, I could remind myself that it's not the end of the world. I could learn from this situation, and improve my time management skills for the future."
261,catastrophizing,Recent panic attack And I think I'm not going to live up to my expectations for my future,"Aside from fearing not living up to my future expectations, I can also consider that these panic attacks could be a signal that I need to reassess my current lifestyle and possibly make changes. There might be an imbalance due to my unrealistic expectations, stress, or other contributing factors. Instead of viewing this as a failure, it might actually be a sign of self-awareness and a chance for growth. I could seek professional mental health resources to understand more about panic attacks and coping strategies. Additionally, I could also redefine my concept of success to create more achievable, less stress-inducing expectations for myself. Perhaps my future might turn out differently than I initially imagined, but it could turn out to be something better, more sustainable and more compatible with my overall well-being."
262,emotional reasoning,"Recent rape, prior trauma, isolation, boredom, loneliness, feeling abandoned and so alone And I think I can't get through this","I recently experienced a traumatic event that has left me feeling isolated and disconnected. My past traumas have resurfaced, making me feel bored and abandoned. However, I'm taking proactive steps to seek help and overcome this state. I'm investing time in addressing my trauma with a psychologist, seeking solace from supportive communities online or in person, delving into enriching activities to divert my mind, learning mindfulness, and reminding myself that my feelings are temporary and I will get through this. I'm considering reaching out to my support system such as friends, family or support groups, or exploring trauma counseling to engage with others who understand what I'm going through. I'm not totally alone as I initially thought, and with strong determination and professional help, I can overcome this."
263,"mind reading,personalizing","Recently I found out that one of my coworkers with who I work closely, organized a party and I wasn't invited to the party. And I think I felt left out and singled out in the office and wondered if the person had a personal grudge against me.","Perhaps my coworker had limited space for the party and could only invite a few people. It's possible that it was a gathering specific to a particular group or hobby that I don't happen to partake in, or maybe they thought I was too busy or wouldn't be interested. It could also be a simple oversight, as human errors do occur. They might have thought they did invite me and are now wondering why I didn't show up or it could be a close-knit family affair which excludes office colleagues. It could also be a party based on a certain department or specific project team of which I'm not part of. Instead of assuming it was a personal grudge, I should consider these other possibilities."
264,overgeneralizing,Rejected from my dream company And I think I never get what I want,"While it's disappointing to face rejection from my dream company, it's not the end of the world. Maybe there is a better opportunity waiting for me out there. Not getting what I want right now doesn't mean I will never get it. Today's denial could just be redirection to something better. Maybe I need to improve certain skills or aspects of myself for better opportunities. I could explore learning new things, working on projects, or seeking internships to strengthen my resume. Furthermore, it's also beneficial to broaden my job search and outlook, as there might be other companies that would suit me even better."
265,personalizing,"Someone criticized the way I dealt with a patient saying that I was too short tempered with them. And I think I felt the criticism was unfair because they didn't take into account the entire situation, especially considering how the patient was behaving towards me.","Perhaps the individual who criticized my approach was only operating with limited information. They might not have understood the full context of the situation, including the patient's abrasive demeanor towards me. Still, their comment might be valuable feedback that could enhance my professional growth. I could reevaluate my strategies when facing challenging situations or patients. For instance, implementing relaxation techniques might help me maintain my calm and patience. Asking a colleague for advice could also give me insights on how to deal with such situations. It's important to remain open to different perspectives, even if they initially seem unfair."
266,mind reading,Someone pushed me and made me bleed And I think I feel like people out there try to take advantage of me and also betray me .,"It's possible that the person who pushed me didn't do so intentionally and my bleeding was an unfortunate accident. I could be interpreting people's actions as harmful because of my past experiences but they might not be out there to get me. Instead, it might be useful to discuss these feelings with a professional, understand where they are coming from, and develop mechanisms to cope and understand others' intentions better. We can't control the actions of others, but we can determine our responses and understanding of such situations. Being open to different perspectives may help me foster healthier relationships and interactions."
267,"labeling,negative feeling or emotion",Someone started a rumor that I'd been banned from an online community when in fact I hadn't. Many people chose to attack my character and one person called me a bully. When I dispelled the rumor and defended myself I was denied an opportunity to defend myself and insulted further. And I think I am a bad person.,"While I felt upset about someone starting a rumor that I'd been banned from an online community that wasn't true, I could consider why the rumor had gotten so far and why people chose to believe it. The person who called me a bully may not understand my true character or they may interpret my actions differently, which is a fault of perception rather than my character. My defense getting denied was the site administrators’ decision, not a reflection of who I am. This situation has given me the chance to examine my online behavior and see if there's anything I can improve on for future interactions, rather than considering myself a bad person. Additionally, the opinions of a handful of individuals on an online platform cannot define my overall worth or character."
268,catastrophizing,Stomach ache every day And I think I might be having a serious illness,"It's possible that my daily stomach ache is due to something benign like diet or stress, rather than a serious illness. It could be caused by irregular eating habits, imbalanced food choices, or consuming too much caffeine, as well as anxiety or lack of exercise. Consulting a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, or adjusting my diet and lifestyle could potentially relieve these stomach aches. In addition, seeing a psychologist may help me manage my anxious thoughts associated with health concerns."
269,overgeneralizing,That's what my mom tells me growing up And I think I'm worthless,"Although my mother often made me feel worthless while growing up, I have the power to redefine my own worth now. I can focus on my strengths, accomplishments and value as a human being. My self-worth is independent of others' opinions - my worth comes from within. I can also choose to surround myself with positive, affirming people who uplift me and help me feel valued and seen. By acknowledging this, I'm taking the first step towards rebuilding my self-esteem and focusing on my innate worth.
"
270,mind reading,"The guy I'm dating went home early one night and I got upset because I thought it meant he didn't want to see me anymore, but I was wrong. And I think I guess he doesn't like me anymore","My partner left early one night. Initially, I had a negative emotional reaction, interpreting it as him losing interest in me. However, it could actually indicate many other possibilities. Perhaps he was tired or not feeling well. He might have had early commitments or responsibilities the next day. He could have been wanting to make sure he doesn't overwhelm me by spending too much time. Or perhaps he's dealing with personal or emotional issues and needed some space to himself. Therefore, it might not be connected to his feelings for me at all, and I shouldn't rush to negative conclusions."
271,emotional reasoning,The host of a party is giving me one-word responses when I try to talk to them And I think I feel like an outcast,"The host of the party might be preoccupied with managing the event and may not have meant to give me one-word responses. Perhaps they are stressed or worried about the party's proceedings and that's why they aren't able to engage in a lengthy conversation. It's also possible that they are just not good at multi-tasking or they might be dealing with some personal issues that I'm not aware of. Hence, their responses shouldn't necessarily be taken as a reflection of my social status or acceptance."
272,"personalizing,blaming,negative feeling or emotion",The team captain on my gaming team approached me to try to remove me as the vice captain on the team citing that they didn't think I was doing enough to assist them. And I think You hardly communicate what you need at all. How am I supposed to help?,"Instead of feeling defensive and blaming the captain for poor communication, I could consider whether there have been opportunities when I could have proactively identified tasks to support the team. Perhaps I missed some chances to offer support because I was too reliant on being given tasks, instead of taking the initiative. Maybe the captain is expecting me to understand what's needed without explicit instructions. I could confirm these possibilities by having a conversation with the captain about their expectations and how I can meet them."
273,negative feeling or emotion,They are racist And I think I hate Republicans,"While it is possible that some people have biased views, it's also possible that not all Republicans share the same views or attitudes. Some may even disagree with certain policies or ideologies widely shared in their party. Rather than assuming they are all racist, I could focus on understanding their individual perspectives. It might even be possible that I could find common ground on shared interests and values with some Republicans. I should try not to resort to blanket judgments of an entire group, as it may lead to further division and misunderstanding."
274,all-or-nothing thinking,They did not convert me as permanent at work And I think I'm a failure,Not being converted to a permanent position at work could be due to a number of reasons that don't reflect on my personal worth or abilities. Perhaps the company had budget cuts or they needed someone with a different set of skills for the particular position. It could be an opportunity for me to broaden my job search and find a position that fits my skills and interests more closely. This does not necessarily mean that I am a failure but could be a stepping stone towards finding the right path in my career.
275,fortune telling,Three days have passed since my job interview and I didn't receive any updates And I think I didn't get the job,"While it's possible that I didn't get the job since it's been three days without an update, it's equally possible that the hiring team is still in the process of reviewing applications and has not made any decisions yet. They could be calling references, which can take time, or the person responsible for interviewing could be out of office. Alternatively, they could have a high volume of applicants and it's just taking longer than expected. It doesn't necessarily mean that I've been unsuccessful. It might just mean they need more time to reach a decision."
276,"all-or-nothing thinking,negative feeling or emotion,labeling",Threw a conniption when unable to complete an Amigurumi project for my niece. And I think I am unable to do this simply damned thing.,"While I did experience an intense bout of frustration when I failed to complete this Amigurumi project, I remind myself that it's okay to not be good at everything. This particular task may have taken more skill and patience than I previously anticipated. Maybe I can look for simpler projects in the beginning to gradually build my skills. It's also possible to seek instructional videos or join crafting groups that can help me improve. Moreover, my value isn't solely determined by my ability to complete this project. I have other skills and qualities that I can appreciate and focus on. Lastly, it might encourage me to understand that failure is often a stepping stone to success."
277,blaming,"Time is running short on the workday, my boss asks me if I can finish a task that will require me to stay for a few extra hours. And I think Why would you wait until the last minute to ask me this.","Instead of focusing on the negative thoughts about my boss's timing, I could consider the fact that I'm valued enough in my position that he/she trusts me with this important task. Additionally, this could also be seen as an excellent opportunity to showcase my dedication and work ethic, which could be beneficial for my future career advancement. Furthermore, this could be interpreted as a sign of faith in my capability to solve problems under tight deadlines. Finally, not everything is planned, it can be a last-minute emergency where my skills were needed most for the company's benefit."
278,all-or-nothing thinking,We had bad storms in our community and some tornadoes came through and destroyed some of the area. No one in our extended family from out of town checked on me. And I think I feel unloved and unwanted by my mother and siblings,"Despite the fact that my mother and siblings did not check on me after the recent storms and tornadoes, it is possible that they were facing their own challenges or disruptions. Perhaps, they are assuming that I was not largely affected since they didn't hear anything specifically from me about the situation. Their lack of contact may not necessarily mean that they do not care about me, rather it could be a sign of their trust in my ability to handle difficult situations. Additionally, feelings of being unloved and unwanted might have deep roots than this situation, and it could be beneficial to explore these feelings in a therapeutic setting."
279,overgeneralizing,"When I told my friend about my job, he said it has little real-world significance And I think My job is worthless","While my friend may have said that they view my job as having little real-world significance, I could consider this as one perspective out of many. Perhaps my friend is not fully aware of what my job entails and the impacts it has. I could bring to mind the times when my work has benefited others or contributed positively to the society. It is also possible that my job’s value is not easily seen or understood by people who are not directly involved in my field. Large societal changes often are gradual and hard for one person to see. Alternatively, if there's a recurring theme of feeling undervalued in my work, it may be beneficial to reassess my career path and consider whether a different job could bring more personal satisfaction."
280,negative feeling or emotion,"When doing some piecework online, I was told that my work was not good. And I think I worked hard on these jobs, and was sure I had done well.","It's possible that the person reviewing my work may not have fully understood or appreciated the effort and creativity I put into it. Their judgement could have been influenced by their personal taste or their interpretation of the guidelines given. On another note, there may have been a minor misunderstanding, a communication gap, or even a technical issue that affected the assessment of my work. It might also be a learning chance, giving me an opportunity to ask for in-depth feedback and improve the quality of my future work. One shouldn't forget that even successful people have faced setbacks and rejection in their lives, and it's all part of personal and professional growth."
281,"negative feeling or emotion,blaming,mind reading","While I was at work, my supervisor questioned my decision in a negative tone infront of my peers. And I think She needs to stop discussing this.","My supervisor may have questioned my decision in front of my colleagues because she thought it was an educational moment for everyone. She potentially believed the situation could be a learning opportunity. Her tone may have been unintentionally harsh, or possibly, I could be overanalyzing her tone due to feeling put on the spot. Maybe I can discuss the situation with her privately, express my feelings, and ask for future conversations to be handled differently. Rather than her stopping to discuss altogether, we could work towards a more productive form of communication."
282,"mind reading,personalizing","While in a group voice chat, everyone left me without saying goodbye. And I think Does nobody want to talk to me?","Perhaps they all had urgent matters to tend to simultaneously, and simply forgot to say goodbye due to their rush. There might have been connectivity issues that caused them all to suddenly drop out. Maybe they assumed I would need to leave soon as well and didn't want to disturb me. It could just be a coincidence rather than a deliberate act towards me. It might also be that they feel comfortable enough with me to end conversations casually, without formal goodbyes."
283,all-or-nothing thinking,Working on a project with Python and have not gotten it to successfully run. And I think Why is it still messed up?,"Maybe the issue I'm having with Python isn't about my skills or intelligence, but more about taking a step back and viewing the problem from a different perspective. Perhaps I'm too fixated on one solution, missing out on a simple fix that could solve everything. It could also be that I just need to take a break, clear my mind, and come back to it refreshed. It might even be beneficial to ask for help, as others may have encountered a similar problem and they could provide new insight. Rather than thinking why is it still messed up, I should think about what new approaches can I take to fix this."
284,overgeneralizing,Would my death have an impact on people? Like is there anyone on here that's had someone close to them commit suicide and knows what it's like? And I think Would anyone care if I died?,"I might feel like nobody would care if I disappeared, but identifying those in my life who would be impacted if I were gone could help me realize I do matter to people. There are probably more people who care about me than I realize in my current state of mind. Alternatively, instead of focusing on my death, I could consider the positive impacts I can make on people's lives while I'm alive. We all leave marks on others' lives in ways we never know. I could also explore whether my feelings of worthlessness are a product of my depression and not reflective of my true value. What if I tried to reach out to someone trustworthy about what I'm feeling? Professional help could provide strategies for managing these thoughts."
285,all-or-nothing thinking,a girl i really liked would not go out on a date with me And I think im not very attractive,"It's possible that the girl is not looking for a relationship right now, or our interests and lifestyles may not align. Maybe, she has other priorities, or we're just not compatible. My attractiveness is not solely determined by her perception or acceptance of me. There are numerous other people who may find me appealing, both physically and in terms of personality. Perhaps I should broaden my social circle to meet new people. Also, I can focus on personal growth and self-improvement such as honing my personal strengths, or taking up a new hobby, which can improve my self-confidence."
286,all-or-nothing thinking,everyone ignores. not their fault I know. Honestly my best friends have been treating me like dirt and idk what to do. I feel so pointless taken all my mental and emotional energy to even send this. And I think No one cares about me,"It could be that my friends are also going through issues that I might not be aware of, thereby making it difficult for them to give me the attention and support I desire at this moment. Although I am feeling neglected, it doesn't necessarily mean that they don't care about me. It's possible that my emotional state is amplifying these feelings and making me assume the worst. Maybe I need to express my feelings to them directly, they might not even know I'm feeling this way. Furthermore, it's important for me to find coping mechanisms outside my friend circle too. Seeking professional help, such as a psychologist, is a step forward in understanding my emotions better."
287,blaming,going through toys that reminded me of the time period that id been abused for And I think I will go crazy if I don't control my racing thoughts,"Exploring alternative coping mechanisms to handle distressing thoughts and emotions related to past abuse. Consider incorporating mindfulness techniques to manage racing thoughts, including grounding exercises such as paying close attention to your sensory experiences or engaging in physical activities that require focus. Regularly remind yourself that the past cannot control your present and future growth. Use the toys as a reminder of your resilience and strength, and not just as symbols of a traumatic past. Practice self-care methods like progressive relaxation, guided imagery, or breathing exercises to calm your mind and body. Seek support from a trusted friend or family member to discuss your feelings or thoughts when they become intrusive and overwhelming. Remember that you're not alone in your struggle and there are resources available for additional support."
288,negative feeling or emotion,hearing loss caused by listening to music too loudly when younger And I think I am a failure,"I might have experienced some hearing loss due to my past habits, but it doesn't necessarily mean I've failed. It implies that I learned a valuable lesson about taking care of my health better. Furthermore, hearing loss isn't entirely my fault; there are many factors at play, including age, genetics, and environmental influences. There's also a wide range of coping strategies and treatments available today, like hearing aids and even some medical advances in regenerative medicine that could potentially reverse hearing loss in the future. This is a challenge for me, not a failure - it could point me toward a direction of self-improvement and better health awareness. I shouldn't judge my entire worth based on one aspect of my life. There are many other areas where I've achieved success and made significant improvements."
289,"overgeneralizing,fortune telling,negative feeling or emotion",high school flashbacks of bullying from when I was conducting placement practice hours And I think I'm never going to be useful to society and it isn't worth living in because humans are extremely hard to understand,"Even though I have endured bullying during my high school years, which I am reminded of while conducting my placement practice hours, I should remember that those are past events and don't define me or my potential. It's true human behavior can be complex, but this can also make it intriguing and rewarding to understand. Instead of thinking I'll never be useful to society, I can focus on my unique skills and strengths that can contribute in my own special way. Life can be challenging, but it is also filled with opportunities for growth and learning, by developing resilience, empathy and acceptance, I can use my experiences to help others and bring about positive changes. I can turn my perceived negatives into positives."
290,none,i and my brother were working in the same office were i am his senior and when he does careless mistakes my boss warned me as i am his senior who is responsible for his work And I think my brother is very careless as he has the feeling that there is no one to ask him as his sister is the one who is senior,"Perhaps my brother is having some difficulties adjusting to the office environment because we're family, and he's struggling to strike a balance between our personal and professional relationship. It could be that he feels less pressure because he sees me as a safety net. On the other hand, my boss's words could also be an encouragement to guide my brother rather than as a criticism or blame. Maybe this situation could actually improve my mentoring abilities and leadership skills. I can approach this by having an open conversation with my brother about expectations and boundaries in a professional setting. This whole situation could also underline the importance of communication in managing personal relationships in a professional setting."
291,negative feeling or emotion,i ate too much and too fast to temporarily please myself but not because i felt hunger And I think i am not able to control my eating habits,"Perhaps I'm using food as a coping mechanism for the stress and other issues in my life. Maybe, I need to develop other strategies to deal with these feelings. It could be possible that I haven't been mindful about eating and have ignored the hunger signals from my body. Perhaps if I slow down my eating pace and pay attention to my body's needs, I could gain control over my habits. Maybe, I need to explore healthier, more fulfilling ways to self-soothe that aren't tied to eating. Additionally, it might be beneficial for me to engage in activities that make me happy and fulfilled, which might decrease my impulse to eat out of boredom or emotional distress. It's also possible that speaking to a nutritionist or health coach could provide me with guidance and strategies to control my eating habits."
292,all-or-nothing thinking,i celebrated a past holiday by myself And I think why don't i have friends? why am i not social? SIGH!,"Maybe I don't have many friends because I'm more selective in choosing company and prefer deep, meaningful relationships over quantity. Also, I am not anti-social, maybe I'm just more introverted and enjoy spending time with myself which is completely okay. Celebrating a holiday by myself gave me a chance to reflect, relax and focus on personal growth. This does not necessarily reflect on my social skills or my worthiness of friendship. It's also possible that I am going through a transient phase, expecting new friends and opportunities in the near future."
293,"emotional reasoning,disqualifying the positive",i dont wanna continue with this life And I think im ready to die,"While I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed and hopeless right now, there could be possibilities of finding ways to work through these feelings. Maybe this is just a really bad phase and I need better coping strategies. There might be support systems that I haven't tapped into yet, or medications and therapies I haven't explored. Possibly, my current state of mind isn't seeing all the options I have around me; this might get better with professional help. This could even be a physical health issue causing emotional distress. Seeing a psychologist might bring fresh perspectives and avenues I haven't considered."
294,all-or-nothing thinking,"i still can't speak or understand korean, even after 6 months here And I think i'm not good enough","Even though I have been living in Korea for six months and can't speak or understand the language fluently, it's important to remember that everyone's learning curve is different. Instead of berating myself for not knowing enough, I could look at the progress I've already made and appreciate my efforts. Six months is a relatively short period to master a new language, especially one as complex as Korean. Also, language isn't the only factor determining my worth. I could be excelling in other areas such as adapting to new cultures, being resilient in a foreign country, or even discovering new skills about myself."
295,emotional reasoning,im scared of the human mind And I think i cant trust people,"While apprehension about people's intentions is normal, it's essential not to let this fear consume me. The human mind might seem mysterious to me, but with proper education I can understand it better. I could also virtually participate in positive group environments like support groups or community activities, to slowly build my trust in people. Additionally, discussing these fears with a professional like a psychologist could provide me with coping mechanisms. Trust is also dependent on individual experiences, rather than generalizing all interactions based on a few negative ones. Remember, every person is different, and not everyone intends to harm or deceive. Trust can take time to build, and that's okay."
296,negative feeling or emotion,"it's so hard to do school work, get out of bed, care for myself, and eat And I think I'm so exhausted","While it's certainly challenging to tackle school work, self-care, and manage daily routine, there might be other approaches to consider that could ease the burden. Maybe I should consider seeking support from friends or family, or look into accessing school counseling or tutoring resources that could help me manage my workload better. Possibly, trying to implement a more structured schedule could helps me get out of bed and accomplish routine tasks. Engaging in daily physical activities could also help boost my energy levels. It might also be beneficial to consult with a doctor regarding potential physical health concerns that may be contributing to my constant exhaustion. Perhaps, my diet is lacking in some essential nutrients that could help me feel less tired."
297,"fortune telling,catastrophizing",last week i went in for a job interview that i thought went very well but then i didnt get the job And I think ill never be able to find a good job,"While it's true that the job interview last week didn't result in a job offer, it doesn't mean that I'll never be able to find a good job. It could be that the job wasn't a great fit, or simply that there was a large pool of candidates and someone else edged me out. Each failed interview is an opportunity to learn and grow, refining my approach for the next application and interview. In addition, there are numerous jobs out there and this particular one is not the only option. I should continue applying and interviewing for other positions, enhancing my skills and qualifications in the process, and not limit myself to thinking one unsuccessful attempt prevents me from future job prospects."
298,"labeling,disqualifying the positive,negative feeling or emotion","my neighbors downstairs were having a party, and would not be quiet so i had to call the police and not get any sleep before work And I think I am being disrespected","While it's possible my neighbors were being disrespectful by having a loud party, they might have also been unaware of how much their noise was impacting me. Maybe they're new to apartment living and don't understand how sound travels. Instead of immediately assuming disrespect, I could try having a polite conversation with them about the noise and explain how it's affecting my sleep. I could also buy noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs to lessen the noise disruption when I need to sleep. I could also look at it from a lighter perspective; perhaps they were celebrating a significant event and it may not happen frequently. Lastly, understanding that there might be times where my own activities may disturb them, opening a line of communication might lead to mutual respect."
299,mind reading,"one of my friend posted a video of a spider getting inside a car, and she so happened to have had her car broken into. So i asked her if the police found whoever broke into her car, and she totally ignored me And I think maybe she doesn't like me anymore.","Maybe she missed my message as she might be dealing with a lot due to the incident and getting her car fixed. Or perhaps she felt uncomfortable discussing the car incident as it could still be a fresh traumatic experience. Another possibility could be that she's too busy dealing with the insurance and the police, so she overlooked my message. In another perspective, she might have thought that my comment trivialized her traumatic experience. Alternatively, she may not have noticed my question about the break-in as it got lost in all the other comments about the spider video."
