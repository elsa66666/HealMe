840,Labeling and mislabeling,"I didn't pass fashion design school, I'm so clueless.",I feel really disheartened and discouraged because I didn't pass fashion design school. I can't help but feel clueless about what to do next. This failure makes me question my abilities and whether pursuing a career in fashion is the right path for me. I need help in understanding my current situation and finding ways to move forward in a positive way.,"I can understand that you're feeling disheartened right now. This situation of not passing your fashion design school is indeed challenging. However, let's try to separate the situation from your thoughts. Not passing doesn't necessarily mean that you're not talented or that a career in fashion isn't right for you. Could it be possible that there might be other factors that contributed to this circumstance?","You're right. There could be other factors that played a role in this, like maybe I didn't dedicate enough time to my studies, or I didn't utilize all the resources available to me. Not passing this time doesn't have to define my entire potential or future in the fashion industry. I need to better understand these potential factors and work on improving them.","That's a great insight! It's crucial to understand that setbacks are part of our growth, and not passing does not diminish your potential in the fashion industry. Let's consider some alternatives under the same situation. What if this setback is an opportunity for you to reassess your strategies and improve? Perhaps this is a chance for you to explore different aspects of the fashion industry, gain valuable experience, or discover other areas of interest within the field? What other possibilities can you think of?","I see your point. This setback could actually be an opportunity in disguise. Maybe I could look at this as a chance to rethink my approach, learn more about what specifically went wrong this time, and work on improving in those areas. This might also be a good time for me to try internships or gain some real-life experiences in the industry that could improve my practical skills. I could even explore other areas within fashion that I hadn't considered before. So, I guess more than anything, this failure can serve as a learning opportunity. It seems less overwhelming when I think about it that way.","That's an amazing perspective you've just shared! It's indeed less overwhelming and more empowering to view this experience as a learning opportunity rather than a failure. Your ability to rethink your approach, learn from your mistakes and desire to apply those learnings through practical internships or by exploring new areas shows great resilience. Keep in mind that setbacks are not indicators of your future success. They're there to point us towards areas we need to grow. You have what it takes to make it in the fashion industry. Persist, learn, and grow. And remember, every step, even if it stumbles, takes you forward.",
841,Catastrophizing,I am a big anime fan. My head will be sliced off with a sword just like my favorite character.,"I have been having this recurring thought that my head will be sliced off with a sword, just like my favorite character in an anime I am a big fan of. It's been bothering me and I can't seem to get it out of my mind. It's starting to affect my daily life and I'm feeling really anxious about it.","It sounds like you're really affected by this image from the anime you love. The image is a fiction and your fear, while very real, is linked to that fiction. Let's try to disassociate the fiction from your actual life. Do you think this is possible?",I understand what you're saying and I want to believe that I can disassociate the fiction from my reality. But the thought feels so real and it's really terrifying. I'll try my best to see it as you're suggesting. It's just very difficult for me right now.,"I appreciate your willingness to try this, even though it's hard. Let's see if we can think of other possible interpretations of this situation. For instance, how about instead of literally seeing it as your death, you see it as a symbol of change or transformation, much like how characters in many stories undergo trials to ultimately become stronger? Can you relate that to anything going on in your own life right now?","Yes, I am currently going through some major changes in my life. I've been feeling a lot of pressure at work and I'm also dealing with some personal issues. Your interpretation of the anime character's fate as a symbol of change or transformation really resonates with me. I can see some parallels between their journey and mine. It's a new way of looking at the situation. I will try to use this perspective when the thought comes to mind.","I'm really proud of the connection you've made there - it's a big step. Recognizing parallels between the character's transformation and your own challenges speaks to your strength and resilience. Remember, just like your anime character, the changes and challenges you're facing today are shaping you into a stronger version of yourself. Let's continue to use this view to combat the negative thoughts when they arise. You're doing wonderfully.",

I feel like such a useless surfer.,I hear you're feeling frustrated because your attempts at surfing weren't successful today. It's essential to remember that your situation of not being able to get up on the board is separate from the thought that you are a useless surfer. Everyone has off days. Does that make them useless in what they're doing?,"No, I suppose it doesn't. I guess I'm just feeling disappointed because I had high expectations for myself today and I couldn't meet them. I understand that everyone has off days, but it's hard not to feel bad about myself.","That's perfectly normal to feel disappointed when expectations are not met. But, let's look at this situation differently. Are there other possibilities or ways of seeing your surfing experience today? Could it possibly be seen as a learning opportunity, or a chance to better understand and improve your technique in the future?",I hadn't thought about it that way before. I was just so hung up on my lack of success today that I didn't consider the positive aspects. I can use today's experience as a guide to improve my surfing technique. I guess it's not the end of the world if I don't succeed every time. It's about learning and improving over time.,"That's a wonderful perspective you've now got! Turning moments like these into opportunities for learning and growth makes you not just a stronger surfer, but also a resilient person. Remember, excellence comes with practice and patience. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's your journey, and every step, whether forward or backward, is progress and part of your unique process. You're absolutely right - it's not the end of the world if everything doesn't go as planned every time. After all, surfing, like life, is all about learning to ride the waves.

843,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,"I booked tickets to London, the weather there will be terrible.","I just booked tickets to London, but I'm starting to worry about the weather there. I've heard it can be quite terrible.","So, your situation is that you're planning a trip to London and your thought is worry about the potential bad weather. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I am really worried that the bad weather might ruin my trip.","I see, let's consider this - even if the weather isn't perfect, are there other things you could still enjoy or accomplish in London? Could there be any advantages to experiencing London in different weather conditions?","Well, I suppose even if it does rain, I could still visit museums and go to restaurants. Also, experiencing London in bad weather might give me a more authentic understanding of what living there is like. I may also get to enjoy indoor activities like theatre shows which London is famous for. So yes, there could be advantages.","That's a great way of looking at it! London has so much to offer regardless of the weather - from world-class museums and restaurants to iconic theatre shows. Your trip can be amazing, rain or shine. Plus, experiencing the city in less than perfect weather will indeed give you a more genuine feel of life there. So let's be open-minded and excited about your trip, as it's bound to be an enriching experience!",

I'll never succeed in my life.,"It sounds like you're feeling down because you go to bed late. Let's try to separate the situation from your overall perspective on success. Just because you are going to bed late, does it mean you won't succeed in anything in your life?","Well, when you put it like that, I suppose going to bed late doesn't necessarily mean I will fail at everything. But I'm often tired and unfocused the next day, which does affect my performance. In that sense, it feels like I'm perpetuating an unhealthy cycle that's keeping me from succeeding.","I hear you say that going to bed late seems to affect your focus and performance the following day, but what if we examined this situation from a different perspective? For instance, what if your late nights are a chance for you to explore solutions that could help improve your productivity during your awake hours, or perhaps it's a chance to adjust your daily schedule to fit your personal sleep rhythm better? What other possibilities could you think of?","I've never thought of it that way. I usually stay up late because I tend to be more creative at night. Perhaps I can utilize those hours to work on projects or brainstorm rather than mindlessly watching TV or surfing the internet. Also, if I can adjust my daily schedule to start later in the day, that would allow me to get enough sleep and still have productive days. I guess there are several possibilities I hadn't considered.","That's a great way to start reframing your thoughts! It's wonderful to hear you recognizing your night-time creativity and thinking about how to use it more productively. Remember, success isn't determined by when we sleep, but rather how we can optimize our waking hours for productivity and positive impact. Your unique creative rhythm could be an advantage in many contexts. Keep thinking in this direction and explore more ways to make your unique schedule work best for you. You're doing great!",

The whole weekend is completely ruined.","I go fishing on weekends, but the weather was bad. The whole weekend is completely ruined.","It sounds like your weekend didn't go as planned due to the bad weather, which frustrated you. The specific situation was bad weather, but the thought is that it ruined your whole weekend. Is that right?","Yes, that is right. I look forward to fishing all week and when the weather is bad and I can't go, it just feels like my entire weekend was wasted.","I can see how that would be disappointing. But let's think about it differently. The weather was bad and you couldn't go fishing, that's the situation, which we can't change. However, can you think of any other activities or things you might have done or enjoyed on your weekend, despite the bad weather?","Well, yes. I always have some books that I want to read and some movies that I'd like to watch. I also enjoy cooking and could have spent the time trying out new recipes. But I'm so fixated on fishing that when I can't do it, I forget there are other things I like doing as well.","That's great to hear! You've just identified other enjoyable activities, like reading, watching movies, or cooking new recipes, that you can do irrespective of the weather. While it's natural to be disappointed if something you look forward to, like fishing, doesn't happen, remember that it doesn't make your entire weekend a waste. Diverse activities can also enrich your life in different ways. Keep this perspective next time when any changes happen unexpectedly.",

I really think I might be the worst singer in the world.,It sounds like you felt uncomfortable because your voice didn't hit the notes as you desired. But is the way you sang in the car this morning really a reliable measure of your overall singing ability?,You make a good point. I suppose one bad singing session in my car doesn't necessarily mean I'm the worst singer in the world. It's just that I couldn't hit the right notes this morning and it made me frustrated and self-conscious.,"I appreciate your insight. Sometimes our performance can vary due to a wide range of factors. Maybe you didn't rest well last night, maybe you didn't warm up your voice before singing or maybe it was just a difficult song. Could there be other explanations for your off-key singing this morning?","You're right. Now that I think about it, I was pretty tired this morning and I didn't warm up my voice either. Also, I was trying a song that I've never sung before, so I suppose that could have made it more challenging. It's possible that those factors played into it. It doesn't necessarily make me the worst singer in the world.","I'm glad you're seeing it from a different perspective now. Feeling self-conscious from one instances of off-key singing, especially under challenging circumstances, is completely normal. Remember, not hitting perfect notes every time doesn’t make you the worst singer. Progress and improvement comes with practice and patience, and it's okay to have off days. Keep exploring your love for singing, and don't let one incident deter you from enjoying it.",
847,Overgeneralization,I live on a beet farm so I'll never afford a new place,"I live on a beet farm, and I feel like I will never be able to afford a new place to live.","I can see that you're feeling stuck because of your financial situation related to living on a beet farm. It's important to remember that your current situation, which consists living on a farm, doesn't automatically dictate your thoughts and feelings about never being able to afford a new place. Situations are not the same as our thoughts about them. Can you tell me more about why you have connected these two?","Well, I've been living on this beet farm my entire life, making little from selling our produce. It feels like there's no chance for me to earn enough to buy a new place somewhere that isn't rural. I'm also worried about abandoning the farm as it's been in my family for generations. It's all I know, and the thought of leaving scares me. I just feel trapped in my current situation.","It's understandable that you feel stuck, given how deeply rooted you are in your current lifestyle and the financial uncertainty in front of you. However, there are numerous instances of people diversifying their income through rural life, and it's crucial to know that there are many possibilities that exist. 

Have you considered tourism or other value-added activities related to your farming? You could look into creating a farm stay or running workshops. Your lifestyle, which you see as a hindrance right now, could become an attraction for others looking for an authentic rural experience. You also mentioned concern over abandoning your ancestoral farm, what if you could tweak it into a sustainable and profitable business without compromising its essence?

Another possibility is exploring other sources of income in addition to your farm. Is there a particular skill or hobby you could turn into a part-time job? Or perhaps even seek scholarships or grants designed specifically for people in your circumstances?

Remember, you're not bound by your current situation. It's all about exploring alternative thoughts and actions. Let's brainstorm more options together.","You're right, I hadn't really considered the possibility of using the farm's potential as a source of income in more creative ways, like tourism or hosting workshops. I guess my thoughts were so consumed by my current situation that I didn't really think outside of the box. I really like the idea of preserving the essence of the farm while making it a more viable source of income.

As for other skills or hobbies, I'm very good with manual work and I love woodworking. Maybe I could look into offering some kind of services or products related to that. As for scholarships or grants, I had no idea these things were available for someone like me. I've always seen them as something for the younger folks getting an education.

You're right, my current situation isn't the entire picture. There are possibilities I hadn't considered before. I feel less trapped now, and more motivated to find new ways to improve my situation. Thank you for helping me see things from a different perspective.","I'm glad to hear you're opening up to different perspectives and possibilities. Your willingness to consider these new ideas shows great adaptability and resilience, which are key strengths during times of change. Your work ethic, rooted in your life on the farm, combined with your woodworking skills, could provide a diverse income stream that goes beyond farming. The farm doesn't only limit you, but also presents unique opportunities. It's great you're recognizing that. It's not easy to change perceptions, but remember, you are not alone in this journey. It's not about abandoning what you have, it's about adding to it to create a life that you are satisfied with. Keep exploring your possibilities and take one step at a time. There's more for you out there.",
848,Discounting the positive,"I've always get complimented on my beautiful brown hair, but anyone with brown hair probably hears the same thing so it doesn't matter.","I've always been complimented on my beautiful brown hair, but honestly, I think anyone with brown hair probably hears the same thing. It doesn't really make a difference.","It sounds like you're grappling with the compliments about your brown hair. Let's break it down - it's one thing to receive compliments about your hair, this is the situation. Then you have your thoughts about these compliments, which are doubting their sincerity. Is that right?","Yes, that's right. I just feel like these compliments aren't genuine, and they're something anyone with brown hair would probably hear. It feels like my brown hair is common, it doesn't feel special, so the compliments feel empty.","I understand why you might feel that way. But let's consider some other possibilities. What if people are complimenting your brown hair because it really is uniquely beautiful? Or perhaps it’s not just the color, but how your hair complements your overall appearance? Maybe the compliments are about more than just the color of your hair. What do you think about these possibilities?","I haven't thought about it that way. I guess it's possible that my hair could be uniquely beautiful, and maybe the compliments aren't just about the color but also about the way it complements my overall look. I will try to reconsider the compliments from this perspective.","That's a great way to reframe the situation! Remember, beauty is unique to each individual and it's more than just one aspect. When people compliment you, they're often noting a harmony in your overall appearance. The way you look is not common, it is unique to you. Next time you receive a compliment, try to see it as a recognition of your unique beauty, not something generic or common. This might help you appreciate the compliment more and believe in its sincerity.",

I can't help but feel like it's my fault. I keep thinking that maybe if I had done something differently, my baby would have survived. I can't shake this feeling of guilt and it's really affecting me.","I can see that you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain right now. It's important, though, to remember that your miscarriage is a situation that happened to you, not a result of who you are or what you've done. It's an event in your life, not a reflection of you as a person. Can you separate yourself from what happened and try to think about possible other reasons for why it may have happened?","Yes, I understand what you're saying. It's hard not to blame myself, but I know it could be due to many different factors like genetic abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or even stress. These things are often out of my control. It's distressing, but I realize that I shouldn't automatically attribute the loss to my assumed shortcomings as a mother.","I'm so glad to hear that you're beginning to comprehend that there are various reasons why a miscarriage might occur, and many of them are out of your control. It's also essential to remind ourselves that such events are unfortunately common, and it does not mean that a successful pregnancy is not possible in the future. Can you maybe think about how this difficult situation might lead to certain growth or understanding that could possibly be beneficial in your life?","Yes, it's true that this miscarriage, as painful as it is, has given me a deeper understanding of how I internalize guilt and how I need to forgive myself. It's also made me realize the importance of emotional resilience and accepting events that are beyond my control. I guess I'm learning to be kinder to myself. This might help me cope with other challenging situations in the future. Life is full of ups and downs, and learning to navigate through them with grace and resilience might be a beneficial outcome from this situation.","I appreciate your courage and resilience in turning this deeply painful experience into a life lesson. It's truly remarkable. Your insight into your capacity to internalize guilt and your commitment to be kinder to yourself are powerful steps towards healing and growth. Remember, it's not the events of our lives that define us, but how we respond to them. You're building emotional resilience that will not just help you cope with future challenges, but also equip you to rise above them. Keep on this path, and don't hesitate to seek help when you need it. You are not alone.",
850,Discounting the positive,People think I am smart because I read so much but anyone can read as much as I do.,"I often feel like people think I am smart because I read a lot, but deep down, I believe anyone can read as much as I do.","It seems like you're struggling with doubting your own intelligence and attributing your knowledge to the amount you read. But let's break this down: The situation is that you read a lot, but the thought is that this is the only reason people think you're smart. Could there be other reasons why they might believe this?","Yes, I suppose apart from reading a lot, I also participate in intellectual discussions, I have a knack for understanding complex subject matter, and I tend to think critically about things. But I can't help but feel like all of this is just because I read a lot. Could it be that I am not actually smart, but just well-read?","That's a good start. You've recognized that you have qualities, such as critical thinking and understanding complex subjects, which go beyond just being well-read. Now, could the ability to comprehend and discuss such complex subject matter indicate intelligence? This means that someone can read as much as you, but not have the same level of understanding or the ability to think as critically. What are other possibilities like this that can contribute to being seen as smart?","When you put it that way, I guess there are several other things that might contribute to someone being seen as smart. Apart from reading and understanding complex subjects, being able to apply that knowledge in a practical or creative way could be a sign of intelligence. Also, having good problem-solving skills, being adaptable and open-minded, and able to learn from mistakes could all be factors. Thinking quickly, having good memory recall, and being able to make connections between different pieces of information are all things that don't necessarily come from reading, and could make someone seem smart. I suppose I hadn't really thought about all of these things before.","You've done an excellent job identifying various qualities that define intelligence, and it's important to acknowledge that these qualities extend far beyond merely reading a lot. It's clear that you possess many of these capabilities. Remember, intelligence isn't solely about the volume of information consumed but how you synthesize, apply, and develop that knowledge. Your adaptability, problem-solving skills, quick thinking, and ability to make connections show that. It's wonderful that you've been able to recognize these strengths in yourself. Keep embracing and nurturing those qualities and allow yourself to acknowledge your intelligence beyond just being well-read.",

I will become homeless and die on the streets.,I am overwhelmed with worry about my financial business. I fear that the weak economy will cause my company to fail. I can't help but imagine myself becoming homeless and dying on the streets. This thought is causing me a lot of anxiety and stress.,"It's understandable that you're feeling stressed and anxious given the economic circumstances. However, it's important to separate your worry about the economy's impact on your business from the catastrophic imagery of homelessness and death. Your fear is amplifying the impact of the situation. Your situation is about dealing with a weak economy, and your thoughts have taken you to an extreme outcome. Could we consider other possibilities that could similarly follow from the same economic conditions?","Yes, I think you're right. The economy is indeed weak, but maybe it doesn't have to mean the end of my company. There could be opportunities for the business to adapt, or we might find a way to weather the storm until the economy recovers. And even if the company did fail, perhaps I wouldn't end up homeless. I have professional skills and experience that I could use to find another job, or I have friends and family who might be able to help me out. It's still a scary situation, but perhaps it's not quite as dire as I've been imagining.","That's a very constructive way of looking at things and it's great to see you considering various possibilities already! A weak economy can also mean an opportunity for some businesses to shine, especially those that can adapt and provide what people need during such times. Apart from your professional skills, think about your toughness, your ability to survive tough situations, or your creativity in coming up with new solutions. Even though the situation is challenging, what other ways can you imagine for your company to not just survive, but thrive in these circumstances? And personally, how might you grow from this situation?","You're absolutely right, there are many things I haven't considered before. In terms of the business, we could look into diversifying or creating solutions that meet the needs of people during tough economic times. Maybe this challenge could lead to new avenues and opportunities for growth that we never conceived of before. 

And personally, overcoming this predicament would certainly make me stronger as an individual and as a business owner. While the fear of failure had previously clouded my judgement, I now see that my situation is something that I can learn and grow from. It isn’t necessarily a dead end.","It's very encouraging to see how you've shifted your perspective towards this situation. Indeed, adversity often breeds innovation and resilience. You’ve recognized that failing isn’t the only possibility, and there are opportunities for both personal and professional growth. Remember, your situation is just a chapter in your life, not the whole story. You have the capacity to navigate through this challenge. Keep exploring these new avenues and stay open to learning and growth, even in the face of difficulties. Your thoughts about the future shape your reality, maintain this positive outlook and continue to confront your fear with rational and solution-oriented thinking.",

However, it sounds like you're equating a current struggle with preparing meals with an extreme outcome like starvation. It's important for us to look at these as two separate things. Your situation is that you are struggling with cooking, your thought is that you may starve because of this. Let's focus on your current situation first. Could there be other possibilities in this situation?","Yes, you’re right. I suppose I could start with easier recipes or even take some cooking classes. There's also an option of getting food delivery or ask for help from someone who knows how to cook. I need to stop letting the fear of the worst possible outcome get to me and look for practical solutions.",Those are some great ideas. You’re definitely capable of finding solutions. Seeking help and starting slow are excellent approaches. Have you also considered watching cooking shows or online tutorials? There are numerous videos available these days that can guide you step by step. Do you think that's another possible option for you to learn and improve your cooking skills?,"Yes, that’s actually a good idea. I hadn’t thought about that. I guess my anxiety took over and blocked any practical solution. I'm going to look into online tutorials and cooking shows, this could be a nice interactive way to learn cooking at my own pace. And, it would definitely be helpful to see the cooking process visually. I'll also consider getting some basic cookbooks for beginners or enroll in some online cooking classes. Thanks for your suggestions.","That's wonderful to hear! I acknowledge your courage in acknowledging and addressing your fear. Using online tutorials and cooking shows is a smart and practical way to learn. There are so many resources available for beginners, and learning at your own pace could turn this challenge into something enjoyable. Remember, it's not about becoming a master chef overnight but about making gradual progress. You're taking great steps towards overcoming your cooking difficulties, and I'm confident that you'll be able to develop this skill with time and practice.

You're currently living in Baltimore, a place you perceive as having a high amount of gang-related crime. And this perception is causing you a lot of stress and anxiety, right? The key here is recognizing that it's your thoughts that are causing your emotional response.","Yes, you're right. It's my thoughts that are causing my distress. It's just that every time I step outside, I fear that something bad is going to happen. Some days, I don't even feel like leaving my home because of this constant anxiety hanging over me. It's hard.","I hear you and your feelings are valid. However, let's try to look at the same situation from a different perspective. Not everyone in Baltimore is involved with gangs or violence, right? There are also a lot of law-abiding, peaceful citizens who live normal, quiet lives in the city. Could it be possible that you're safe and that the pervasive fearful thoughts might be a lot worse than the actual situation? Remember that fear often amplifies the chances of a threat in our minds.","Yes, I understand your point. It's true that there are many people in Baltimore who are not involved in any kind of gang violence and they lead a normal life. My fear is probably making the situation seem much worse than it actually is. It's just not easy to ignore those thoughts. I will try to focus on the quieter, positive aspects of life in the city and hope that I can manage my fears better.","I appreciate your openness to consider a different viewpoint. Yes, it's not easy to manage fear, but acknowledging that your thoughts might be adding to the problem is a significant first step. By focusing on the positive aspects of your city and realizing that many people live safe, normal lives there, you can start to shift your mindset and alleviate your anxiety. Remember, it's okay to seek help if you need it. Reach out when you feel overwhelmed and know that it's possible to live a peaceful, fear-free life. Your fears do not define your reality. ",

Why don't we try to dissect the situation a bit? Can you identify what exactly makes you feel this way about your job?","There are a few reasons that come to mind. The biggest one is that I feel there's not much room for growth or progression in this job. I also feel that my skills and abilities surpass the responsibilities given to me here. I love plants and gardening, but I also have much more to offer. Sometimes I feel like I am not being intellectually challenged enough. This feeling of stagnation keeps nagging me, making me wish to find a better job.","It's understandable that you want to take up different challenges and progress in your life.

Maybe start a personal project related to plant care, run workshops to share your knowledge, or even start a gardening blog or YouTube channel. What other possibilities spring to mind when visualizing your capability in the current position?","You're right, this situation could be an opportunity rather than an obstacle. Perhaps I've been too focused on moving away from my job that I've overlooked the potential it holds. I never thought about leveraging my love for gardening professionally. I could certainly start gardening workshops or create a gardening blog to share information with a broader audience. I could also think about opening up my own nursery or online plant store someday. Maybe, even collaborating with local schools to teach kids about gardening can be an option. I suddenly see so many possibilities, thank you.","That's fantastic! It's so heartening to see you've uncovered a wealth of opportunities where you once saw none. Starting a gardening blog, running workshops, and opening your own nursery sound like excellent ways to use your skills and passion to do something that's fulfilling and challenging for you. Collaborating with local schools could also let you contribute to the community. Remember, every expert was once a beginner. It’s never too taxing to start something new and meaningful. I encourage you to explore these ideas further. You have a unique set of skills and a passion that many people don't. Use them to create something unique that allows for growth and challenges you intellectually.",
855,Labeling and mislabeling,"I currently am in the navy, I'm probably going to be labeled as a war criminal forever.","I currently am in the navy, and I can't shake off the fear that I'm going to be labeled as a war criminal forever. It's a thought that constantly haunts me and affects my self-worth. I feel overwhelmed by the possibility of being judged and condemned by others.","I understand how you're feeling. It's important to remember though, that being in the navy doesn't automatically equate to becoming a war criminal. Your fear is not linked to your current situation, but seems to be more about your negative perception of it. Can we delve into other possible outcomes that could arise from your service?","Certainly, I appreciate that perspective. When I consider other possibilities, I can see that my service could lead to promotions, a commendable record, and a great learning experience that instills discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. I suppose I could also be a role model to others inside and outside the military. I guess, there are other outcomes that are equally, if not more likely than being labeled as a war criminal. I realize my mind has been skewed towards the most negative outcome.","That's a great start! You're recognizing multiple positive outcomes from serving in the navy. It's beneficial for character building, gaining respect, and can open up a lot of opportunities. Can you think of other potential positive aspects? For example, think of the friendships created, the respect gained from your nation or how you're contributing to a broader cause. Reframe this in your thoughts, and hopefully, you'll see that the fear you're experiencing is just one possibility among many. You aren't defined by a single possibility.","Yes, now that I reflect more on this, I see there are several other positives. I've forged strong friendships, learned valuable skills, and been part of some really important missions. The respect and gratitude I receive from civilians is very rewarding. On a larger scale, I am playing a part in maintaining peace and protecting our country which is a very noble cause. I can focus on these aspects and view my service in the navy more positively. It's clear to me now that my fear of being labeled a war criminal is quite irrational. It's just one unlikely, negative outcome out of many possible positive ones.","That's a very commendable perspective. Remember, fear of judgment isn't a part of who you are but merely a feeling that's stemming from a potentially skewed perspective. Your important role in maintaining peace, upholding justice, and the friendships you've built are real, valuable outcomes of your service. Keep focusing on those positives. You're doing an incredibly challenging job, and it's essential to remember the good you're contributing and the growth you're experiencing. Let's keep these positive aspects at the forefront of your thoughts.",
856,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,I'm a stay at home mom. I'm sure people think I don't want to work.,I sometimes feel insecure about being a stay-at-home mom because I worry that people might think I don't want to work.,"It's essential for us to seperate the situation from your thoughts. The situation here is being a stay at home mom. It's a choice you made for personal reasons or circumstances. The thoughts that are bothering you are the assumptions you're making about what other people might think of your role. However, remember that these are assumptions and not necessary facts.","Okay. I understand that being a stay-at-home mom is the situation I'm in, and the insecurities about what others might think are just assumptions I'm making. It's hard to separate these things though, but I'll try.","Yes, it can be hard, but that's okay. 

Let's try to think about other possibilities. You've been assuming people might think negatively of your decision. 

But could there be people who admire you for the sacrifice and commitment to take care of your family? Or those who wish to be in your position so they can spend more time with their kids but can't for various reasons? Or others who understand that being a stay-at-home mom is a full-time job itself and respect that? Could these also be possibilities?","You're right. I hadn't really considered those possibilities. There could indeed be people who do appreciate the job I have chosen and see value in it. I've been too focused on the negative assumptions, and it's a relief to think about the positive responses others might have.","I'm really glad to hear you considering these other possibilities. Remember, there's immense strength and value in what you're doing as a stay-at-home mom. It's a significant job that requires a lot of dedication, commitment, and love. Your fears are understandable, but they're based on assumptions, not facts. Try to stay open to the positive possibilities as much as you do to the negative ones. Rest assured, there are many out there who admire your choice and find it highly respectable. Take pride in your role. After all, it's your life and your choice, and the most important thing is that it works for your family and you feel good about it.",
857,Discounting the positive,My neighbor is a dog trainer and act like there is something special about training dog when anyone can jut become a dog trainer,"I've been feeling quite frustrated lately because my neighbor, who is a dog trainer, always seems to act like there is something incredibly special about training dogs. It seems to me like anyone can just become a dog trainer if they put in the effort and learn the necessary skills.","I see you're having strong emotions about your neighbor's attitude towards dog training. But remember, it's your interpretation that anyone could do it if they put in the effort, and shouldn't discredit their profession or devalue their skill. Can we take a step back and look at the situation objectively?","Yes, you're right. I should try to be more objective. My frustration is probably more related to my neighbor's attitude rather than the profession itself. Maybe I need to appreciate the skills required to be a good dog trainer rather than assuming it's something anyone can do.",That's a great outlook to have. Now think about other possible interpretations of your neighbor's pride in their job. Could it be that they take a lot of pleasure in what they do? Or that they're satisfied with the effort they've put in to learn this skill? What other viewpoints can you consider in this situation?,"You're right again. I should consider the possibility that my neighbor genuinely enjoys his job and takes pride in being a dog trainer. Maybe he has put in a lot of effort and time to master his skills, and what I perceive as arrogance could actually be the pride in his accomplishments. It's a new perspective and I should be more understanding and open towards other's passions and professions.","I'm really glad to hear you're considering these new perspectives. Seeing your neighbor's attitude as a representation of his pride and commitment to his craft, not as arrogance, is a thoughtful interpretation. It's important to remember that everyone has a unique journey and their passions may differ. Understanding this can lead to more empathy and less frustration on your part. Your progress in reframing your thoughts is commendable! Stick with this open-minded approach, it can make a significant difference in how you perceive situations around you.",
858,Labeling and mislabeling,Many consider me a nerd. I'm such useless social person.,I often find myself thinking that many people consider me a nerd and that I am a useless social person.,"I hear your concerns about feeling perceived as a nerd and feeling socially inept. Let's try to separate the situation and your thoughts. What is the actual situation you're facing, and what are the thoughts that you're forming based on that situation?","The actual situation is that I spend a lot of my time studying and engaging in traditionally 'nerdy' activities like coding or playing chess. As for socializing, I seem to struggle when it comes to interacting with others. These are the things that are leading me to think that people consider me a nerd and a socially inept individual.","It seems you are very committed to your studies and hobbies, and that's commendable. Now let's think about other possible ways to look at the same situation. For instance, could there be people who might admire your dedication? Or people who share similar interests in coding and chess? How might someone see your struggles with social interaction differently? And just because you struggle with it now, does that mean it will always be this way? What do you think about these possibilities?","You're right, there might be people who admire my dedication and there could be others who share similar interests in coding and chess. I guess, my struggles with social interaction could be interpreted differently by different people. They could see it as me being shy or introverted rather than as a sign of social ineptitude. And I suppose, it's also possible for me to improve my social skills over time. I hadn't thought about it from such perspectives before.","You've done an excellent job exploring alternative perspectives and reframing your thoughts! Keep reminding yourself that you're much more than a label. Your dedication and skills can be seen as strengths by many, and your struggle with social interactions could be interpreted differently- every person has different strengths. Also, remember that you have the ability to grow, change, and develop social skills over time. Keep exploring these new perspectives and let them change how you view yourself and others.",
859,Mental filtering,"I visited my sister in Canada this fall. It was horrible. Even though it's beautiful, the weather was so cold we had to stay inside most day.","I visited my sister in Canada this fall and had a terrible experience. Despite the beauty of the country, the cold weather forced us to stay indoors most of the time.","It sounds like you're saying the situation was that you visited your sister in Canada during the fall, and the thought that upset you was that the cold weather forced you inside, which negatively impacted your experience. Is that right?","Yes, that's correct. I was really looking forward to exploring the outdoors, but the harsh weather conditions made it impossible. It was pretty disappointing and frustrating.","I understand how that can be disappointing. Let's try to think of this situation in a different way. Even though the weather kept you indoors, were there any positive aspects? For example, did you find any enjoyable activities to do inside, or perhaps it was an opportunity to have in-depth conversations or bonding moments with your sister?","Yes, we did spend a lot of quality time together. We haven't seen each other for a long time, so we spent hours catching up, cooking together, and even binge-watching some series. I also got to play with my nephews and be a part of their daily routine. I guess I just focused too much on what I couldn’t do instead of what I could do.","That’s a great realization! Even though the weather limited your outdoor activities, it facilitated some precious moments with your sister and nephews. It’s perfectly normal to feel disappointed when our plans don’t work out. Yet reframing those moments as opportunities rather than hindrances can help us unearth the silver lining. Our perspective has a significant impact on our emotions and experiences. So fostering a mindset that seeks out the positive can make a great deal of difference. Keep focusing on the positives, even when things don't go as planned.",
860,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,If my car breaks down my career will suffer.,"If my car breaks down, my career will suffer. I depend on my car to travel to work and meet with clients. If I can't get around easily, it will be difficult for me to maintain my professional commitments.","It sounds like you're really concerned about the impact of your car breaking down on your career. The situation is your car potentially breaking down, but your thoughts are focused on how it might affect your work. They are two separate issues. Let's try to explore each one separately.","You're right. I do rely heavily on my car for my work and the thought of it breaking down worries me a lot. I realize that these are two different problems, but one affects the other, which is causing me to stress over it.","Understood. Now, let's think about what else could happen if your car breaks down. Think about all the different solutions or outcomes there could be to this situation. For instance, could you utilize public transportation or ride-sharing services? Or maybe there's an option to have meetings virtually instead of in-person? If your car does breakdown, could you rent a car while yours is being repaired? Try to think about as many different scenarios as possible, not just the negative one you initially focused on.","You're right, I think I've let my fear cloud my judgment a bit. There are indeed other alternatives. I could use public transportation or even hire a cab if need be. I could also utilize car rental services while my vehicle is being repaired. I hadn't considered the option of holding meetings virtually, but that is a viable option as well, especially during these times. There are many alternatives and potential solutions to my problem. Thank you for helping me realize it.","I'm really glad to see you exploring other possibilities and not just focusing on the negative outcomes. You've come up with some great alternative solutions that not only can keep your work flowing but also will help reduce your stress about your car potentially breaking down. It's important to remember that uncertainties are a part of life and they can be managed effectively by being proactive, just like you did now. Keep up this flexible and problem-solving mindset; it can transform challenges into opportunities.",
861,Overgeneralization,My mom taught me how to play the cello but I always flub my auditions. I will never perform well under pressure.,"I've been playing the cello for a while now, but no matter how hard I try, I always mess up whenever there's a lot of pressure, especially during auditions. I feel like I'll never be able to perform well when it really counts.","It seems like you're feeling anxious and doubting your abilities because of the pressure you face during auditions. Let's try to separate the situation. The situation is that you have auditions where you have to perform. Now, your thought about this situation is that you always mess up and you believe you'll never be able to perform well under pressure. Am I correct?","Yes, that's exactly how I feel. I get so nervous and then I believe that I can't play well when I'm under pressure. It's really affecting my confidence and making me question my ability.","I understand it's a challenging situation. However, let's try to brainstorm other possibilities. You're nervous because you care about the outcome of your auditions, right? Let's consider an alternative thought: what if the pressure could be seen as something that could enhance your performance rather than hinder it? How about framing it as excitement and an opportunity to show your skills? Could some of the best performances come when the stakes are high? What are some other thoughts you could have about this situation?","You're right, I've never really thought about it from that perspective. I guess I can try to view the pressure as a form of excitement or as a challenge. If I really think about it, some of my best practice sessions are when I feel that excitement or slight nervousness. Maybe I can try to remember those moments during auditions. It could be possible that high stakes could bring out the best in my performance. That's definitely a different thought than what I've had before.","It's wonderful to see you exploring different ways to view the situation! The idea of viewing pressure as a form of excitement or a challenge opens up new ways of thinking about your auditions. I really appreciate your efforts to step outside your comfort zone and consider this perspective. Remember, some of our greatest achievements occur when we're slightly out of our comfort zone. Try carrying this new thought into your next practice session, and over time, you might not only build confidence but also enhance your performance. You've got this!",
862,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I want to teach kids but I'll never be a teacher because the job market is so competitive.,"I've been thinking a lot lately about my passion for teaching kids. I have such a strong desire to guide and educate them, but I've been feeling discouraged about pursuing a career as a teacher. It seems like the job market is incredibly competitive, and I fear that I may never get the opportunity to do what I love.","It sounds like you're really passionate about teaching, which is wonderful, yet there's worry about how competitive the job market is. Let's separate the scenario: there's strong desire on your end to teach, and on the other hand, there's the situation involving job market competition. How these two relate is something you're internalizing negatively.",You're right. These two points of view are conflicting within me. I want to follow my passion for teaching but the thought of not being able to secure a job due to the intense competition is making me anxious and doubtful about my career choice.,"Yes, these two thoughts are indeed conflictual. However, keep in mind that a competitive market indicates high demand for quality teachers. So, another way to see it could be as an opportunity for you to shine in a field that needs passionate educators like you. Furthermore, if finding a position immediately is challenging, you could pursue related roles to build your resume while you continue your job search. Have you considered these possibilities?",I've not really looked at it from that perspective before. It's true that a competitive market does mean there's a high demand for good teachers. I guess that does present an opportunity for me to stand out if I can prove myself to be a quality teacher. And the idea of taking on related roles to build my resume while searching for a job does make the situation seem less daunting. Thank you.,"I'm glad you're considering these new perspectives. Remember, your passion for teaching and dedication can really set you apart in a competitive market. And, building your resume through related roles can enhance your skills and provide valuable experiences. Stay positive and continue working towards your goals, even when challenged. It's brave to pursue what you're passionate about in spite of difficulty, and that in itself is a great step forward. Keep believing in yourself and remember that your journey is unique, it's not a race. You're on your own timeline, and that's okay. Stay determined and keep moving forward.",
863,Should statements,My sunflowers grow so well that I should win 1st place in the gardening competition.,"I've been taking care of my sunflowers so diligently, and they've been growing so well. I think they're the best in the neighborhood, and I'm starting to believe that I have a good chance of winning first place in the gardening competition.","That's already a beautiful achievement, taking care of sunflowers and seeing them grow well. You have an ongoing situation which is participating in a gardening competition, and a thought of winning that competition. Now, let's try to see them separately. Even if the competition wasn't there, would you still enjoy taking care of your sunflowers?","Yes, I definitely would. I love seeing them grow, and it brings me a lot of satisfaction and joy. The competition is an exciting addition, but it's not the only reason I'm doing it. The process and the results are rewarding enough for me.","That's wonderful to hear. Now, let's look at the different possibilities in the perspective of this gardening competition. What if, even though you don't win, you gain some valuable insights and knowledge about gardening that you didn't have before? Or perhaps, it allows you to connect with other gardening enthusiasts in the neighborhood? Or you receive some unexpected appreciation and admiration for your gardening skills? Can these alternate outcomes also add to your satisfaction and joy?","Yes, those outcomes would also be rewarding. I hadn't thought about it that way before. The knowledge I'll gain and the people I'll meet are definitely positive aspects of participating in the competition. And, of course, any appreciation for my hard work is always welcome. Even if I don't win, it's not a loss. It's a gain in different ways.","I'm incredibly proud of you for recognizing those additional positive possibilities! That's a great mindset to have. Remember, essentially, the joy is in your journey of nurturing your sunflowers and growing yourself in it. Gaining knowledge, meeting new people, and earning appreciation are all meaningful victories in their own right. Winning a competition certainly adds to the joy, but it is not the only source of fulfillment. Just keep doing what you love with passion and joy, and no matter the competition's outcome, you are already a winner.",
864,Overgeneralization,I tripped when visiting the local park. I'll never be able to walk there safely.,I tripped when visiting the local park. I'll never be able to walk there safely.,"I understand that you're feeling distressed after tripping in the park. But let's try to separate what happened from your thoughts about the situation. The fact is, you fell once, but does that necessarily mean you'll fall every time you visit the park?","No, that doesn't necessarily mean I'll fall every time. But the fear of falling again makes me feel uncertain about walking safely in the park.","I can understand why you might feel afraid after tripping. That can be a scary experience. But let's think about other possible outcomes. For instance, you could possibly learn to be more cautious and that may prevent future falls. What other possibilities can you think of?",Maybe I could take someone with me when I visit the park or change the time of my visits when the park is less crowded. I could also choose to avoid the areas where I might trip easily. These could be safety measures to prevent future falls.,"That's a great approach, you've identified effective strategies to manage the situation. Embracing these alternatives not only illustrates your resourcefulness but also your determination to overcome your fear. Remember, it's perfectly okay to trip or fall sometimes; it's a part of life.

So, the situation is that you're failing to find a stamp. And the thought you have is that you're a useless collector. Am I correct?","Yes, that's correct. I keep questioning my abilities as a collector because I can't find this final stamp. It's really getting me down.","I understand how important this is for you. But let's consider other possible scenarios under the same situation. Could it be that the stamp is simply rare or hard to find? Or maybe it's an opportunity to learn new searching methods, which will make you an even better collector in the long run?   ","You're right. I had not thought about it like that. The stamp might indeed be rare, making it all the more valuable and exciting to find. And in the process of searching for it, I could actually learn new strategies for hunting down rare stamps. Even if I don't find this stamp soon, this experience might make me a better collector. Thank you for offering a new perspective.","That's a very constructive way of reframing your experience! You've shown great insight in understanding that the rarity of the stamp could actually add to its excitement and value. And learning new methods in your search will indeed make you a better collector. Thanks for courageously embracing this perspective. Remember, the value of a collector is not defined by a single stamp but by their passion, determination and willingness to learn. Keep on collecting with this renewed perspective!",
866,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I was planning to do some cloud watching this weekend but it will be sunny. My entire weekend is ruined.,"I was really looking forward to doing some cloud watching this weekend, but it's going to be sunny instead. Now I feel like my entire weekend is ruined.","I understand that you're disappointed because the weather is not going to be as you expected, which you thought would ruin your weekend. But let's see if we can explore this more. Could the weather forecast alone really determine the quality of your entire weekend?","Well, when you put it that way, I guess it's not exactly the weather forecast alone that would ruin my weekend. It's more about the unfulfilled expectation of engaging in an activity that I enjoy. So, no, it's not entirely about the weather. It's about not being able to do something I was looking forward to.","That's an insightful observation! The weather forecast may not allow you to engage in cloud watching as planned. However, are there possibly other activities that you could enjoy doing on a sunny day? Are there any other options that might even be enjoyable but you haven't considered yet?","You're right. I've been so focused on this one activity that I didn't really think of what else I could do. I guess I could go for a hike or take a bike ride. Those could be enjoyable activities for a sunny day. I still feel a bit disappointed, but I think I have alternatives to consider now.","I really commend your openness to explore other possibilities, it's a significant step towards reframing your thinking. It's perfectly natural to feel disappointed when expectations don't align with reality, but remember that sunny weather offers its own perks like you've just mentioned - hiking or biking. These are active pursuits that can also bring joy and fulfillment. So, even though the weather wasn't as you hoped, your weekend can still be fantastic! Just imagine the sun on your skin while you're hiking or feeling the wind while biking, all these experiences are equally worthwhile. Let's focus on the positive, and you might be pleasantly surprised!",
867,Discounting the positive,I've 2 sisters but that doesn't matter as neither of them like me anyway.,"I've been feeling really lonely lately because I have two sisters, but it feels like neither of them like me anyway. It's been causing a lot of pain and sadness for me.","I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It's important to remember that your feelings of loneliness and the perception that your sisters don't like you, are two separate things. Feelings can often cloud our interpretation of situations. So let's take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Can you share more about why you feel your sisters don't like you?","Well, they don't talk to me much and when they do, it's only about things they need or updates about their lives. They don't ask about my life or how I'm doing. If I try to talk to them about my stuff, they seem disinterested or sometimes they just change the topic immediately. They also hang out together a lot but never invite me. It's like they have their own world and I'm just an outsider in it.",I can understand why you might be feeling left out based on your experiences. Let's consider other possibilities for their behaviour. Could it be possible they don't realize they're not involving you as much because they're used to their own routines? Or perhaps they assume you're busy with your own things? It might also be the case they're not aware how much this is impacting you. Could any of these scenarios be possible?,"Yes, I suppose those possibilities could be true. They are both older than me and have always been very close since they are only a year apart. Maybe they're just used to a certain relationship dynamic and I somehow fall out of that. Maybe they're not doing this intentionally. I hadn't really thought about it from that perspective.","That's an insightful realization. Sometimes, longstanding dynamics in family bonds may unintentionally create feelings of exclusion in others. It's quite possible that your sisters may not even be aware of how this is affecting you. Acknowledging this can be the first step in creating a change. Have you considered expressing your feelings to your sisters? They may be more receptive than you think, especially if they understand how you've been feeling lately. It's definitely a step worth considering.",
868,Overgeneralization,I usually go to be late. I'll never be able to succeed in my life,I usually go to bed late. I'll never be able to succeed in my life. I always feel like I am lagging behind and not making the most out of my time. It's been weighing heavily on my mind and I want to break free from this negative cycle.,"I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. But it's important to recognize that going to bed late doesn't necessarily link directly to your success in life. So, the first step is realizing that this is a situation, and your thoughts and emotions about it are separate. Are there other reasons why you feel you're not succeeding or making the most of your time?","Yes, there are other reasons. I always procrastinate my work until the very last moment and end up rushing through it. This has been impacting the quality of my work and I keep getting negative feedback about it. I try to manage my time better but I always end up wasting it on things that are not even important. It makes me feel like I am not doing enough and I am not capable enough to improve my situation. I feel stuck.","I understand that you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed because of the procrastination and the negative feedback. But what if we consider this situation from a different perspective? Could it be possible that you're not just a procrastinator, but perhaps you just haven't found the right strategies that work for you to manage your time effectively? Are there any habits or routines you could incorporate into your day that would allow you more control over your time and your work? Let's try to think about this and brainstorm other ways to improve your situation.","You're right, looking at it from this perspective, it could be that I am not doing it right or maybe I am not prioritizing my time and tasks well enough. My stalling tactic could be because I am not certain about how to approach my work or start with it. Maybe I could try starting my day by making a to-do list. I could also set small goals for each task and take breaks in between so I don’t feel overwhelmed. And I would have to be strict about sticking to this routine. That could be a good starting point. I guess I just need to figure out what strategies work best for my situation. It's not going to be easy but I know I need to do it if I want to improve my situation.","You've made some wonderful observations about your situation and I completely agree with you. Creating a daily to-do list, setting small goals and taking regular breaks can be effective ways to manage your tasks. It's important to remember that it's okay to take small steps and gradually make changes. It can be challenging, but remember, you have the capability to improve your situation. Just the fact that you're here seeking help and actively thinking about strategies shows your dedication and resilience. Keep reminding yourself that each small success is a step towards your larger goals. You're already on the path to improvement.",
869,Discounting the positive,"My back hurts chronically, I believe I will die soon",I've been experiencing chronic back pain and it's making me worry that something serious is wrong. I can't help but think that this pain is a sign that I'm going to die soon.,"I understand that the persistent back pain is causing you a lot of distress. But it's vital to remember that your pain and these fears about an impending serious condition, including death, are two different things. Our mind often jumps to worst case scenarios when we're uncomfortable or scared. Can we explore your thoughts a little bit more?","Yes, doctor. I understand where you're coming from and I'm ready to explore my thoughts more. I constantly find myself thinking about the worst-case scenario because this pain seems unending and unbearable at times. It's completely taken over my life. I am afraid and that's what's bringing thoughts of death and I just can't shake them off.","I see that the pain has been really impacting on your day-to-day life and that's led to some very distressing thoughts. However, chronic back pain, while discomforting, doesn't necessarily indicate a serious illness or mean that death is imminent. There can be many reasons for this, such as stress, poor posture, or muscle strain. Have you considered any of these alternate explanations? Do you think it may be possible that the fear of the pain could be magnifying these thoughts of seriousness? Let's try to think of some other less catastrophic outcomes.","You're right Doctor, I haven't considered those alternate explanations. The pain scares me so much that I skip right to the worst case scenario. It's possible that the fear could be tying into my thoughts. There's also a chance that it could be stress or due to poor posture, as I have a desk job where I sit for long periods. I suppose I have just been too consumed by the thought of it being something more serious. I'll try and focus on understanding that there might be less serious reasons for my pain. Thank you.","I'm so glad to hear that you're opening up to other possibilities. It's completely normal to have fears and worries when dealing with chronic pain, especially when it impacts your daily life as much as yours does. It's great that you've considered other options like stress or poor posture.

870,Labeling and mislabeling,"I don't have the time to foster kittens, I should get rid of my two cats because I can't take care of animals.","I've been feeling overwhelmed lately with my responsibilities, and I've been thinking that maybe I should give up my two cats because I don't think I have enough time to take care of them properly. Specifically, I've been considering getting rid of them because I don't have the time to foster kittens, which I've been wanting to do, and I feel guilty about it.","I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and that's okay. Let's try to separate things out. There's your current situation, which is having multiple responsibilities, and then there's your thoughts about this situation, particularly about not having time to care for your cats and foster kittens simultaneously.","You're right. My current situation involves having a lot of responsibilities, and my thoughts about this situation are mainly focused on the fact that I don't have enough time to properly care for my cats, let alone foster kittens. It's making me sad because I love my cats and kittens, but I just feel so overwhelmed.","I see how tough this is for you. While the idea of giving up your cats is one possibility, there might be other options under the same circumstances. For instance, could there potentially be a way to balance your responsibilities so that you have enough time for your pets? Perhaps there's a possibility of seeking help from friends, family, or professional pet care services? Or could fostering kittens be something you do in the future when things might be less overwhelming? It could also be worth considering if there are tasks or responsibilities that could be minimized or delegated to free up some more of your time. What do you think of these possibilities?","You know, I hadn't really considered those options. I've been so consumed by the thought of giving up my cats that I can't visualize other possibilities. The idea of seeking help from friends or family, or even professional pet care services seem like a good idea. Maybe fostering kittens can be a future endeavor when I'm less overwhelmed. And you're right, I could look into tasks that could be delegated. I'll need to mull over these options. Thank you for helping me see beyond my current line of thought.","I’m really glad to hear that you’re beginning to consider other possibilities. It's natural to feel overwhelmed when we face many responsibilities, and it's courageous of you to consider new ways of handling this. Remember, we all need help sometimes, and it's okay to ask for it. Taking care of yourself and effectively managing your responsibilities don't mean you love your pets any less. You're a dedicated pet owner and by acknowledging these feelings and brainstorming alternatives, you're showing your commitment to finding a balance that works best for you and your pets. Take some time, think over the possibilities, and remember, it's alright to choose the option that feels right for you.",
871,Personalization,"I lost a level in my Super Mario game, it's because I'm not talented","I recently lost a level in my Super Mario game, and it's been making me feel like I'm not talented enough.","I see. Let's try to reframe this. Although you lost a level in your Super Mario game, does this directly imply that you lack talent?","No, losing a level in a game doesn't necessarily mean I lack talent. I might need to strategize more effectively, practice more, or simply accept that everyone fails sometimes. It's not a reflection of my overall ability or potential.","That's a very positive perspective! In addition to the possibilities you've already suggested, can you think of any other factors that might have influenced the outcome of the game? Are there other explanations as to why you didn't pass the level this time? Could it be that the level was harder, or that you were more tired or distracted than usual?","You're right. There could've been many reasons why I didn't clear the level. It could've been more challenging than the previous ones, or maybe I was just tired or not as focused as I usually am. Thanks for helping me realize that not passing a level in a game doesn't necessarily imply that I'm not talented, there could be many factors at play.","It's wonderful to see how you've broadened your perspective. Yes, there can be a number of reasons for not clearing a level this time - a momentary lack of focus, fatigue, or the level's difficulty. Keep in mind that failure in one attempt does not determine your overall abilities or potential. You are capable, and practice, time, and perseverance will undoubtedly lead to improvements. You are more than the result of a single game level. Keep going!",
872,Mental filtering,I work in a movie theater. I want to quit my job because moviegoers are always so noisy.,"I work in a movie theater, but I want to quit my job because all the moviegoers are always so noisy. It's really frustrating and it's starting to make me dread going to work every day.","It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and stress at work due to the noisy environment. It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way, but let's try to separate the situation from your feelings. Is the noise the only problematic factor at work, or are there other elements that cause you to dread going in?","Yes, the noise is my primary issue, but there are other aspects that bother me too, like cleaning up after messy moviegoers and dealing with difficult customers. However, if it weren't for the constant noise, I think I would be able to tolerate those problems. It's just that the loudness on top of everything else is making me consider quitting.","I can see how the combined factors are making your work situation extremely stressful for you. However, let's consider some possible ways we could reframe this situation. What if you had noise-canceling headphones, or there were specific quiet hours? Perhaps there are other roles in the movie theater that are less noisy or roles that could make use of your skills but within a less noisy environment. What do you think? Any other possible solutions come to your mind?","Well, I had not considered the possibility of using noise-canceling headphones. That might certainly help me cope with the noise issue. Also, asking about a less noisy role is an interesting idea. Maybe I could work in the projector room where it's usually quieter. Your suggestions have given me some new perspectives to consider about my situation. As for other possible solutions, I think if I were allowed some regular breaks to clear my head and rest my ears, it might also make the noise more bearable.","It's wonderful to see you exploring these fresh perspectives. Your ideas about using noise-canceling headphones, enquiring about quieter roles, and incorporating regular breaks are all excellent strategies to help you better manage the noisy environment. By being proactive and strategizing on how to make your work situation more tolerable, you're taking control over your situation. Let's continue working on these and other possible solutions. Remember, it's your resilience and adaptability that will help you through this challenging time.",
873,Should statements,"I want to fly so bad, flying schools should allow complete beginners to at least have the chance to take a plane for a little flight.","I have always had this strong desire to fly. It would be amazing if flying schools could offer opportunities for complete beginners, like me, to have a chance to take a plane for a little flight.","It's wonderful to see how passionate you are about flying. Let's break your thought down a bit. On one hand, there's your situation of being a beginner with a desire to fly, and on the other, there's your thought that flight schools don't offer opportunities for beginners.","Yes, it feels like I am in a bit of a bind. I have this strong fascination and desire to fly but because of my lack of experience, I feel like I am being barred from realizing my dream. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest.",I understand how the feeling of being barred from pursuing your passion can be frustrating. Let's consider some alternatives. Could there be flight schools designed specifically for beginners? Or maybe there are private instructors who could offer you basic training? There might also be flight stimulator games that could give you a feel for flying? Let's explore these possibilities.,Those are some interesting alternatives that I hadn't thought of. I guess I was so focused on the traditional route of flight schools that I didn't consider other options like private instructors or flight simulators. These could be good stepping-stones towards achieving my dream. It just requires a bit more research and outreach on my end. Thank you for giving me a new perspective on this.,"I'm glad to hear you're thinking of those options as stepping stones toward achieving your dream. They indeed could be excellent ways to channel your passion and gain some foundational knowledge before moving forward. Remember, each small step you take gets you closer to where you want to be. Please proceed confidently with your research and outreach, knowing you have the ability to make this dream a reality. Your journey to becoming a pilot has already begun with these considerations. Keep believing in yourself!",
874,Personalization,The battery in my new laptop died already and it's surely because I didn't do enough research when buying it.,"I recently bought a new laptop, but it seems like the battery died way too soon. I probably didn't do enough research before making the purchase.",It's clear you're feeling some regret about your recent laptop purchase due to the battery issue. But remember your situation - a laptop with a bad battery - is separate from your thoughts. It doesn't necessarily mean you didn't do enough research. Let's explore this a bit further.,"Alright, perhaps I did do a decent amount of research before I purchased the laptop. It's possible that the battery issue is just a software glitch or a fault with this particular unit. Things like this could happen to anyone, regardless of how much research they do when purchasing a laptop.","Absolutely, your laptop issue could indeed be due to a software glitch or a defect in the particular unit you received. In the same vein, what other possibilities may exist? For example, could it be the manufacturer's responsibility? Might they possibly assist you in this situation? What other thoughts come to mind thinking about the problem this way?","You're right. It's also possible that the manufacturer shipped a faulty unit. If that's the case, this issue should definitely fall under the manufacturer's responsibility, not mine. They might even replace the battery or the whole laptop. Reconsidering this situation does relieve some of the guilt and regret that I was initially feeling.","That's an excellent reframing of the situation. It's always important to remember that sometimes things are beyond our control and it's not your fault. You've made a solid investment in a laptop and you have every right to get what you paid for. Don't hesitate to contact the manufacturer. Moreover, try to let go of the guilt and regret, as they might cloud your judgment in dealing with this situation positively and efficiently. You've already shown great problem-solving skills in coming up with these new possibilities.",
875,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,i can t cook and my friends think am a jerk because of it.,"I feel really insecure and self-conscious about my cooking skills. It seems like my friends judge me and think I'm a jerk because of it. It's affecting my self-esteem and making me feel like a failure. I want to be able to cook and impress others, but I just can't seem to get it right.","It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and I can see how these feelings might be hard for you. However, it's important to remember that your assumption that your friends judge you is your interpretation of the situation. What actual evidence do we have of this?","You know, you're right. My friends have never directly said anything derogatory about my inability to cook. But it's just the way they look at me or joke around that makes me feel that they're judging me. But again, these are my interpretations, I guess. I might be wrong.","It's great that you've recognized these are your interpretations. Remember, people can act in many different ways for many different reasons. Can you think of other possible meanings or reasons behind their reactions? Maybe they're joking to lighten the mood or their looks could be interpreted in a different way?","Yes, I suppose it's possible. Perhaps they joke around about it to make it less awkward for me or maybe they're not as bothered by it as I assume they are. Maybe they don't even care about my lack of cooking skills but are just happy to be my friends and enjoy our time together. I haven't really thought about it in these terms before.","Absolutely, and it is very plausible. It's impressive that you've been able to see these new perspectives - real friends value who you are as a person, not your cooking skills. What's most important is the company you share, and not always about impressing them. Keep being open to other perspectives as they can positively affect your self-esteem and feelings of worth.

876,Mental filtering,Ill never get to enjoy art as much as i want because i have an anxiety disorder and don't get to go to museums.,I feel really down because I don't think I'll ever be able to fully enjoy art because of my anxiety disorder. It's frustrating because I can't go to museums and experience the beauty and inspiration that comes with it.,I can see how your anxiety disorder is creating a difficult situation for you. But could it be possible that your thought about "never being able to fully enjoy art" is separate from your actual condition?,"Yes, I suppose that's possible. I tend to feel overwhelmed when I think about situations like going to museums, which I associate with enjoying art. It's hard for me to separate my love for art from the anxiety I feel about being around a lot of people or in new places.","I understand. Anxiety can certainly make things more challenging. But could there be other ways for you to enjoy art without the anxiety-triggering environments, like museums or crowded places? Let's think about those possibilities together.","Yes, I suppose there are. I could try to find ways to enjoy art at home or in smaller, less crowded settings. Online virtual tours, art books, or even creating art myself could be options. Maybe I have been fixating too much on the traditional way of enjoying art and overlooked other possibilities.","That's a wonderful insight! It's true that the beauty of art is not confined to museums. You are opening up to a whole new way of enjoying art that suits you. You have shown great creativity in thinking of other ways to appreciate art. Embrace these alternatives and remember, the beauty of art is in the eyes of the beholder, and you can choose where and how to behold it. Your love for art is unique to you - enjoy it in your own unique ways.",
877,Personalization,One of the kids I teach in elementary school failed a test. It's because I'm the worst teacher.,I feel really responsible and guilty when one of the kids I teach in elementary school fails a test. I can't help but think that it's because I'm the worst teacher.,"I can see that you're feeling guilty about a student failing a test, and you seem to be attributing it to yourself as a failure. But let's try to look at the situation and your thoughts separately. The fact is a student failed a test, that is separate from the thought that you are the worst teacher. Can you see the distinction?","Yes, I understand that the fact of a student failing a test and me believing I'm the worst teacher are two different things. It's just hard not to connect the two.","I understand it feels hard not to make that connection. However, multiple factors can contribute to a student's performance. It can be due to their personal issues, lack of focus in studying, or they might simply have a bad day. As you see, there are many possibilities that can lead to a student failing a test, beyond you being a bad teacher. Can we explore these other possibilities?","Certainly, now that you mention it, I remember that the student has been distracted in class lately due to some family issues. So, maybe his personal situation affected his performance. Also, there might have been some topics that he had difficulty understanding. You're right, it's not just about me being a terrible teacher. There may be other contributing factors.","That's brilliant to consider! You've rightly identified that there could be multiple contributing factors, including their personal situation and comprehension of certain topics. It's important not to perceive yourself solely responsible for all outcomes. You're there to facilitate their learning, but their performance also greatly depends on manifold variables that are out of your control. So, let's focus not on guilt, but on how we can support our students in various ways within our teaching role. You're doing a great job.",
878,Should statements,People should be reading the back of food containers or never complain about getting sick,I believe that people should take more responsibility for their health by reading the back of food containers. It frustrates me when people complain about getting sick without doing their due diligence in understanding what they're putting into their bodies. It's essential for them to be aware of the nutritional information and potential allergens in the food they consume.,"It sounds like you feel passionate about nutrition education and preventative health care. You're upset when people don't check their food for nutritional information and allergens, and complain when they fall ill. It's important, however, to understand that these are your thoughts and your approach towards health. Other people might have different approaches or circumstances.","You're right, I understand that everyone has their way of managing their health and nutrition. I guess I feel frustrated because it seems like some people are not taking care of themselves properly. And it's hard to see them complain about something which, in my opinion, could have been prevented. But I should respect the fact that not everyone share the same insights as I do.","That's a well-rounded understanding! It can indeed be difficult to see people complain about illnesses that you feel could be prevented with proper care. However, remember that there could be numerous reasons for this. Maybe they lack the proper education or resources about nutrition, or they might have other priorities that, for them, come before health. Or it's also possible that they are dealing with circumstances that don't enable them to focus on their nutrition as much as they'd like. Can we consider those possibilities?","Yes, I see where you're coming from. I hadn't considered the multitude of possible factors in others' lives that could contribute to their negligence towards nutrition. Not everyone has the same knowledge, time, resources, or even the same health goals as me. I should be more understanding and less quick to judge others for their choices without knowing their circumstances or perspectives better.","That's a remarkable realization! It's easy to get frustrated when people don't align with our beliefs or values, especially when it comes to health. But as you've recognized, everyone's circumstances and priorities differ, and it's important to practice empathy. Keep in mind, you can channel your passion for health awareness into positive actions such as promoting nutritional education or supporting accessibility to healthier choices. This way, you'd be contributing towards a larger solution, all the while maintaining a respectful understanding of individual differences.",
879,Catastrophizing,walking on the beach is very dangerous as a wave could hit and kill you,I have been feeling really anxious about walking on the beach lately. The thought of being hit by a wave and potentially being killed is constantly on my mind. It's making it difficult for me to fully enjoy and relax at the beach.,"I can tell this thought is causing you considerable tension. Let's take a step back and examine the situation separately. You're at a beach, it's a place of leisure and relaxation. Your thought, however, relates to a fear of potentially hazardous waves. These are two different elements. Do you think it might be possible that your thoughts are magnifying the actual risk?  ","You know, when you put it that way, I guess I could be magnifying the risk in my mind. The beach is indeed a place of leisure and relaxation for most people, and I used to feel the same way too. This fear of waves seems excessive now that you've pointed it out. But, I can't help but feel fearful.","I'm glad you're open to considering other perspectives. Let's uncover different possibilities. For instance, could there be safe zones at the beach where the waves are more gentle? Or could you engage in beach activities that don't involve being in direct contact with the waves, like building sandcastles or playing games on the beach? What other possibilities can you think of that allows you to enjoy the beach while managing your fears?","Well, now that I consider it, there are indeed areas at the beach where the waves are known to be calmer. Maybe I could place my sunbed and umbrella in those zones or even look to visit the beach at times which are known to have lesser wave activity. Also I can involve myself in other activities, like you said, building sandcastles or playing games which keep me engaged and distracted from the waves. This is starting to make me feel a little better and giving me ideas on how I can manage this fear. I could stick to these safe zones and activities that don't involve being in the waves.","That's really insightful! You're absolutely right in thinking about safer zones on the beach and considering visiting the beach at times with lesser wave activity. Engaging in beach activities that divert your attention can indeed make your visits enjoyable, reducing your anxiety. Remember, courage isn't about eliminating fear, but rather knowing how to manage it. Give yourself credit for exploring these alternative views, and allow yourself to take these steps. Embrace the beach for its calming breeze and golden sand, and step by step, you'll see your fear diminish.",
880,Overgeneralization,I eat unhealthy so every meal I eat moving forward doesn't even matter.,"I eat unhealthy so every meal I eat moving forward doesn't even matter. It feels like I'm stuck in this cycle of unhealthy eating, and it's discouraging to think that trying to make healthier choices won't make a difference.","It sounds like you're feeling quite stuck and overwhelmed by your current eating habits, and you believe it's pointless to try and change. Is it correct to say your situation is that you've been eating unhealthy and your thoughts about this situation are that every future meal won't matter because you believe it won't make a difference?","Yes, that's exactly how I feel. I'm stuck and it feels like it's too late to make any changes. I'm feeling really hopeless about this.","I hear you and it's understandable that you might feel it's too late considering your past habits. This indeed might seem a challenging situation. But, would you consider other possibilities? Could it be possible that every meal is a new opportunity to make better choices? Can making gradual healthier choices bring about positive change, no matter how small they might appear at first? Are there any examples you could think of?","Well, I did start drinking more water instead of soda a while ago...and I guess that did make me feel a little bit better. So maybe you're right. Maybe it's not too late to start making better choices. It's just that the idea of overhauling my entire diet feels incredibly daunting. Like I've dug myself into a hole and I can't climb out. But you're right, I suppose I could try making small changes, one meal at a time.","That's excellent! You've already started creating a positive change by opting for water over soda, and that's a big step. Yes, the idea of changing an entire diet can be incredibly daunting, but remember, no one is asking you to do it all at once. It's all about taking small, manageable steps, just like you did with the water. Each healthy choice you make counts and gradually, they all add up to big changes. It's never too late to start making better choices. You're capable of amazing things. Let's focus on one meal at a time, and celebrate every small victory.",
881,Overgeneralization,I'm dieting while I study to be a veterinarian.  It is difficult information and I really don't think I'll ever be able to truly help animals.,"I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I'm currently studying to become a veterinarian, but it's been really challenging. On top of that, I'm trying to stick to a strict diet. I can't help but think that I'll never truly be able to help animals.",It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now with studies and your diet. It's important to remember that these are two separate challenges. Feeling overwhelmed doesn't necessarily mean you'll never be able to help animals. ,"Yes, you're right. I guess I'm just conflating the two things. The stress from my diet and study is making me question whether I'd be good enough once I graduate. I constantly fear that I might not be able to help animals in need.","It's understandable to have those fears when facing stress. Let's think of some other possibilities. Could it be that this stress is just part of the process of becoming a qualified vet? Maybe once you graduate and begin helping animals, you might find the work more fulfilling than stressful. Have you thought about how your diet and academic stress could, in fact, be giving you the discipline and perseverance that you'll need in your future profession?","Thank you for putting things in perspective for me. You're right, maybe the stress I'm currently enduring is part of the learning and growth process. And the discipline and perseverance I'm honing through sticking to my diet and coping with my academic pressures could indeed equip me better for my future responsibility. I really hadn't thought of it that way before.","I'm really glad to hear you acknowledging the reality of the situation and understanding it in a different light. It takes courage to face these challenges and it's commendable how you're managing them. Your current struggles are building your resilience and strength, equipping you not only to be a successful vet, but to weather any storm life throws at you. Remember, it's through the toughest times that we grow the most. You're on the right path, persevering, growing, and learning. Keep going. You're doing a great job.",
882,Labeling and mislabeling,I lost an ancient artifact at the museum. I am an incapable handler.,I lost an ancient artifact at the museum. I am an incapable handler.,"I understand you're feeling upset because you've lost an artifact at the museum. But let's separate this situation from your self-belief. You misplaced an item, that's a fact. Now, you saying you're an ""incapable handler"" is your interpretation of the situation. Does that sound about right?
","Yes, that does sound about right. I do tend to be quite critical of myself, especially in situations like this. I feel like I should have been more careful.","I see, it's completely natural to feel that way. But let's consider other perspectives. It's a fact that you lost the artifact, but could there be any other possibilities? For example, could it be that you were tired or distracted by something else going on? Could the artifact have been misplaced by someone else, or could there have been a system failure, or maybe some other reasons? What do you think?","You're right. There were a number of factors at play that day. The museum was really busy, I was juggling a couple tasks at once, and I was also feeling quite tired. Although I do blame myself for losing the artifact, it's possible that these other factors contributed to the loss. I hadn't really thought about it like that before.","Absolutely, it's important to consider all those factors and it's great to hear that you're recognizing that it isn't solely your fault. Keep in mind that we all have off days where multiple factors can affect our performance. Being tired and having to juggle multiple tasks aren't signs of being incapable - they're simply part of being human. You're a dedicated handler and you're learning from this experience. We can use it to improve any future situations that might be similar. You're doing well.",
883,Discounting the positive,Many of my paintings are in an art gallery. Nowadays anyone can throw paint at a canvas and an art gallery will think it's great.,"I feel frustrated and somewhat discouraged because I've worked hard on my paintings, but now it seems like anyone can create something similar and have it displayed in an art gallery. It diminishes the value of my own work and makes me question its worth.","It sounds like you’re feeling invalidated because you see other people creating similar art. Just to clarify, you're associating the presence of similar art in the gallery with a decrease in the value of your own work, which in turn makes you question the worth of your efforts. Is that correct?","Yes, that's exactly what I'm feeling. I've put so much effort into my unique style and technique. It's disappointing to see other's less sophisticated work being admired and it's causing me to question my own skills and dedication.","I see where you're coming from, but let's consider some other perspectives here. First, let's remember that art can be subjective and what one person admires, another might not. What if the presence of similar but less sophisticated art actually highlights the uniqueness and superiority of your own work? Can we think about the possibility that the admiration for those works might lead to comparisons which will in turn amplify the value and effort you put into your own pieces?","Yes, I suppose I haven't thought about it from that angle. Maybe the presence of these paintings could indeed help others appreciate my work more. I've been focusing on the negatives, but I guess we all experience art differently and it may encourage them to value my technique. The comparison might indeed help them see the effort I've put in. I should try to see this as an opportunity, not a setback.",That's a wonderful perception shift! The art world can be incredibly varied and subjective. What's important here is your recognition that your emotional responses to these situations don't devalue your talent and effort. Keep holding onto your unique style and dedication. Seeing the situation as an opportunity shows your strength. Continue trusting in the value and the quality of your work because the right audience will always appreciate good and hard-earned art.,
884,Overgeneralization,"I'm 29 years old, and know that I'll never have kids if I don't do it right now.","I'm 29 years old, and lately, I've been feeling this pressure to have kids. I know that if I don't start trying soon, it may not be possible for me in the future. It's been weighing heavily on my mind and causing me a lot of anxiety.",It sounds like you're feeling anxious about the idea of having children given your age. Let's focus on your current thoughts versus the situation. Can you describe how you see the situation and the thoughts that are creating anxiety for you? This will help us to understand it better.,"Well, I see the situation as a sort of a ticking clock. I'm close to 30 and fertility supposedly decreases as one gets older. I'm not even sure if I'm ready to have kids, but I'm scared that if I wait much longer, I might not have the chance. These thoughts are increasing my anxiety a lot. I'm worried I might regret it later if I don't have kids now. But at the same time, I'm not sure if this is the right time for me. It feels very confusing and overwhelming.","I understand you're feeling anxious about this perceived ticking clock. It's normal to have these concerns about important life decisions. However, let's create some space to consider other viewpoints. Can you think of any different aspects of your life or other factors that might affect your decision? For example, have you considered technological advancements in fertility or other potential pathways to parenthood? Or perhaps, your feelings around your readiness to embrace these changes? Let's brainstorm some alternate possibilities together.","Yes, I see what you mean. When I think about it that way, there are other options. Technological advancements in fertility treatments could allow me to have children when I am older. Moreover, adoption or fostering are ways to have children that don't depend on my own biological clock. Speaking of readiness, I realize that if I'm not ready now, it might not be fair to bring a child into the world until I am. But it's still challenging because I never thought I would worry about this kind of decision at this stage in my life.","I appreciate your openness and effort in brainstorming these alternatives. It's indeed a difficult decision, and it's okay to have these uncertainties. It's absolutely crucial to feel ready when you decide to have children, whether it's naturally, through fertility treatments, or considering options like adoption or fostering. Remember, having kids is an experience that can materialize in many diverse ways and at different stages in life. It's not a race against time, but rather a journey that is unique to every individual. Your anxieties are valid, but don't let them limit your perspective of the vast array of options and strategies available to you. You're courageous for facing these feelings head-on, and with time and introspection, I'm confident you'll make the decision that resonites with your life and aspirations the most.",
885,Should statements,I want to be an astronaut when i grow up but maybe i should not go in that field instead go become a doctor,"I have always had this dream of becoming an astronaut since I was a child. But lately, I've been having second thoughts about pursuing that dream. Maybe it would be better for me to go into the medical field and become a doctor instead.","I see that you're feeling torn between your childhood dream and another career path. Let's isolate these thoughts. You have a dream of becoming an astronaut, but there's also this thought that perhaps becoming a doctor might be a better option. Right now, we're just discussing possibilities, so no decision has been made yet.","Yes, that's correct. This whole process feels so overwhelming though. What if I make a mistake or choose a path and end up regretting it? I'm scared of making a decision and then feeling stuck in the wrong career.","I understand that it feels daunting, but let's consider alternative perspectives. What if you were to consider these career paths not as a life binding choice, but as exploratory routes that can lead to self-discovery? What if the choice you make isn’t perfect, but provides valuable life and career lessons? What if the decision you make opens up opportunities you'd never considered? What other possibilities can you think of in this particular situation?","Well, I guess I could look at it as a learning experience rather than a final choice. Maybe even if I choose to become a doctor and later realize it's not for me, the knowledge I gain from medical school could still be incredibly useful in different ways. And I guess no matter what path I choose, I could always make a change if I'm unhappy, even though that idea feels quite scary. Going with my gut and pursuing my dream of space exploration could open doors in fields I've not yet considered, like research or teaching. It's definitely a lot to think about.","I'm really impressed with your ability to reframe this challenging decision. Remember, each step you take is not a dead-end but rather a stepping stone in your life journey. It sounds like you understand that there are multiple paths ahead of you, each with its own unique set of learning experiences and potential avenues. Trust in your ability to navigate your career, be flexible, and learn from each step along the way. Your apprehension is natural, but don’t let the fear of making a mistake paralyze you from moving forward.",
886,Personalization,My football team didn't win today.  It was because I didn't cheer hard enough.,I feel really guilty about my football team not winning today. I keep thinking that it's my fault because I didn't cheer hard enough.,"It sounds like you're holding yourself accountable for your football team's loss today due to your level of cheering. But remember, your cheering is one component among many factors in a game. Are there other potential reasons that might have led to the team's loss?","Yes, I guess you're right. There could be many other factors like the team's preparation, the skills of the opponent team, or just overall performance of our team that day. But somehow, I can't escape the feeling that my lack of cheering played a significant part.","Indeed, those are all great insights into the other factors that could have impacted the outcome. Now, let's consider those factors you just mentioned, and possibly others, that are more directly related to the result of the match. For instance, how about the strategy of the coach, the physical condition of the players, or even the weather conditions? Your cheering is a form of support, but the outcome of a football game relies primarily on the performance of the players and the team's preparation, don't you think?","Yes, when you put it that way, it does make a lot of sense. I suppose I have been focusing too much on my role and not considering all the other aspects of the game. The players' performance and overall strategy do play a more significant role in the outcome. You're right. I think I need to reevaluate how I've been looking at this situation.","It's really brave and insightful of you to reconsider your perspective on this situation. Your passion and support for your team are commendable, but remember, a game's outcome is decided by so many factors beyond our individual control. Your cheering certainly adds to the team spirit, but it's not solely responsible for the win or loss. Keep supporting your team, but also allow yourself to enjoy the game without carrying the weight of the result on your shoulders. After all, it's the love of the game that brings us all together.",
887,Catastrophizing,"I forgot an ingredient in my chicken soup recipe, my family is going to think I'm the worst cook ever.",I forgot to add an ingredient in my chicken soup recipe and now I'm worried that my family is going to think I'm the worst cook ever.,It sounds like you're distressed over the soup not being perfect. But forgetting one ingredient does not necessarily define your cooking skills. Could it be that you're taking this one incident and generalizing it to your overall ability in the kitchen?,"You're right, I might be overthinking this. Forgetting one ingredient doesn't mean that I'm bad at cooking. It's just a small mistake and it doesn't define my overall ability in the kitchen.","That's a significant recognition. Now, let's try to think of this from alternative perspectives. What are some other possibilities that could come from this situation? Maybe the soup might taste just as good or even better without that ingredient? Or it could be a learning experience for your future cooking? What do you think?","Actually, that's true. The soup might still taste good even without that specific ingredient. It might even bring out other flavors that I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. And yes, this can definitely be a learning experience for me. I can be more mindful next time and make sure to check all the ingredients before I start cooking.","That sounds like a very positive take on the situation! You've acknowledged that every experience, even those that appear as mistakes, can serve as learning opportunities. This isn't about forgetting an ingredient, it's about growing as a cook. And who knows, your family might actually enjoy trying something new. You’re nurturing your skills and being open to the outcomes. Keep up the good work, and trust in your abilities.

888,Mental filtering,"My favorite color is green, but so is my twin brother's. He always wears green and it upsets me so much because it's my favorite color.","I have been feeling really bothered lately because my twin brother always wears green, which happens to be my favorite color as well. It's frustrating because I feel like he's stealing something that's important to me.","It sounds like your frustration is stemming from seeing your brother wear green, which is your favorite color, making you feel like something precious is being taken away. Is this correct?","Yes, that's exactly right. I feel like he's encroaching on something that should be exclusively mine. It does feel like he's taking away something that's special to me. I know it sounds petty, but it's been bothering me a lot.","I can see why you feel that way. Now, I want you to try and think about this situation in other ways. For instance, can you think of any other interpretation for your brother's choice to wear green? Could there be a chance that green is also his favorite color or he simply appreciates it? What other possibilities might there be?","Well, when you put it that way, it's very possible that he genuinely likes green too. We grew up in the same environment after all and have had a lot of shared experiences, so it's not too far-fetched. Maybe he doesn't even know how much it's bothering me and he's just wearing it because he likes it. That thought makes me feel a bit better about things.","I'm glad you're seeing it from other perspectives. It's indeed possible that he might just be wearing green because he likes it too, without intending to upset or annoy you. Remember, your favorite color is a part of who you are, but it doesn't solely define you. Your personal value is not diminished because someone else likes the same color. I encourage you to talk to your brother about your feelings, he may not even be aware that it's bothering you. This could also strengthen your bond as siblings.",
889,Catastrophizing,"I work all the time, I'll probably die on the job.","I work all the time, I'll probably die on the job. It's been consuming my thoughts lately, and I can't shake off this feeling of impending doom. I constantly feel overwhelmed and stressed, and the thought of it leading to my eventual demise terrifies me.","I'm sorry that you're feeling this way. It's apparent you're going through a lot. Let's separate the situation and your thoughts. The fact is that you're working a lot. Your thought is that it could lead to serious health consequences, even death. It's important to remember that your thoughts are not always a reflection of reality.","You're right. I understand that my thoughts are possibly exaggerations. But, I can't help but link my constantly being occupied with work to the possibilities of serious health issues. I'm scared that I'm putting too much strain on myself.","It's absolutely normal to be aware of the strain you're putting on yourself but remember, the current situation can lead to multiple outcomes. Could there be other possibilities that you might not have considered? For instance, could this hard work lead to professional growth? Or maybe this phase of intense work could be temporary and you'd be able to find a better work-life balance soon? Could you think of other potential outcomes?","Yes, I see what you're saying. I suppose I could also look at it the other way. My hard work could help me climb up the ladder in my career. Or once this current project ends, there's a possibility that I'd have more free time to relax. Also, if I keep working hard, I'd be appreciated and maybe even rewarded at work, which is a positive outcome.","That's a great perspective! I'm really proud of you for considering these other outcomes. While acknowledging your fears about your health, it's essential to consider the potential positives. Your hard work could indeed lead to career advancement, recognition, and rewards. It also seems like you'll soon have a chance to catch your breath once this intensive project is over. Keep in mind these positive outcomes and try to maintain a healthier balance between work and rest. It's important for stress management and overall well-being. Your dedication is commendable, but remember, your health is just as crucial. You're doing great, keep going!",
890,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I like to cook a lot. But I will never be a great chef.,"I enjoy cooking a lot, but sometimes I feel discouraged because I believe I will never be a great chef.",It sounds like you're feeling discouraged about your cooking skills. Let's take a step back. Can you tell me more about why you enjoy cooking and why you believe you can never become a great chef? The two thoughts don't necessarily have to be connected.,"I enjoy cooking because it is therapeutic for me. I love the process of preparing ingredients, following or improvising a recipe, and the satisfaction of creating something delicious. However, when I compare my skills to professional chefs I see on TV or social media, I feel like I am way behind and can't reach their level of expertise and creativity. That's why I think I will never be a great chef.","I understand, it's easy to compare ourselves to professionals we see on media. But have you thought that those chefs have possibly undergone years of training and experience to get where they are today? Or maybe they too started like where you are, enjoying cooking and creating their own dishes. Could it be possible that with continuous practice and dedication, you can enhance your skills and creativity to a higher level? Let's explore other perspectives to this situation.","Yes, I suppose you're right. Professional chefs have indeed undergone years of training and they gain a lot of experience before reaching their current level of expertise. Although it seems daunting, with continuous practice, dedication, and a passion for cooking, I might enhance my skills and creativity to a higher level. Perhaps my comparison is creating a mental barrier for me to see my own potential. It'd be better to focus on my own journey and growth rather than comparing it to others. It may take time, but I might become a great chef in my own right one day.","I'm really glad to hear your perspective shifting. You've rightly caught on that each individual's journey is different and unique, and comparison with others can sometimes set unrealistic expectations. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. So keep embracing your passion for cooking, continue striving to better your skills, and be patient with yourself. Who defines 'great' anyway? You're already a great chef in your own way when you bring love and joy to the process of creating something delicious. I'm certain, with time, you'll see your culinary skills blossom even more!",
891,Discounting the positive,I thought I was a good ski person but I have seen many of my own family and friends do it with ease.,"I always thought that I was a good ski person, but lately, I've been seeing my own family and friends effortlessly gliding down the slopes. It's starting to make me doubt my own skiing abilities.","I can understand why you might feel this way. However, it's crucial to remember that our perceptions are not always reflective of reality. Let's try to dig a little deeper into this. On one hand, you have your experiences of skiing, which you've always enjoyed and thought you were good at. On the other hand, you are comparing yourself with others, which is causing you to question your abilities. These are two separate things - your ability to ski and your comparison with others.","That's true. I do enjoy skiing and it's not like I have any problems doing it. But when I start comparing myself to others, I suddenly feel like I'm not as good. I suppose I've been so focused on comparing myself to them that I'm not focusing on my own progress or how much I enjoy the activity.","That's a great observation. Now, let's consider some alternative ways to view the situation. What if, instead of seeing your friends and family as competition or a measure of your skills, you saw them as people who simply have their own style or approach to skiing? Or, instead of comparing yourself to them, you focus on your own progress and improvement? What other possibilities can you think of to interpret this situation? Remember, everybody has their own pace and style in learning and practicing skills. It doesn’t necessarily mean one is superior to the other.","You're right. Maybe I've been too hung up on comparisons. Instead of worrying about how well I'm doing in relation to others, I should just focus on improving my own skills and enjoying the experience. This is a much healthier perspective. I can even look at their techniques to learn something new, rather than seeing it as a competition. And maybe I've been overlooking my own progress in skiing because I've been so caught up in these comparisons. I'll try to think more along these lines. Thank you.","I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing things from a different perspective. It sounds like a much healthier and more enjoyable way to approach your skiing. Remember, it's about the journey, not just the destination. And every skier's journey is unique. Comparisons can often lead us astray from our own unique path of learning. By focusing on your own progress and enjoyment, you’ll likely find the experience much more fulfilling. Keep up the positive outlook! You're making excellent progress in redefining how you perceive your abilities.",
892,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,"My mother is in the hospital, but won't let me visit her. She probably doesn't want to speak to me because I have a lot of medical bills.",I feel really hurt and confused that my mother won't let me visit her in the hospital. My mind keeps going to the thought that it might be because she doesn't want to talk to me due to my medical bills. It's making me feel guilty and like a burden to her.,"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight right now. Let's try to separate the situation and your thoughts. What we know is your mother has restricted hospital visits. Your interpretation of why that action was taken is where your concern lies – the idea that your medical bills might be the reason. However, there may be other possibilities. Can you think of any other reasons she might not want you to visit?","Yes, I guess there could also be other reasons. Maybe she's very ill and doesn't want me to see her in this condition. Or, given the current situation with the pandemic, she might be trying to protect me from catching anything. It could also be possible that she doesn't want me to stress about her health on top of my own condition and medical bills.",That's a great step forward. You've already come up with several other possible explanations for her behavior. These certainly seem more about her caring for your well-being rather than laying blame on you. Could it also be possible that she might consider her hospital environment not pleasant for a visit or that she doesn't want to add more to your plate? What do you think about these possibilities?,"Yes, those possibilities make sense as well. She has always been protective and might want to spare me from worrying more, which a visit to the hospital certainly can do. Looking at these other possibilities, I realize that there could be several other reasons why she won't let me visit her aside from my initial thought about my medical bills. This truly makes me feel less guilty.","I'm really proud of you for being able to explore all these other potential reasons. It certainly sounds like your mom might just be trying to protect you out of love and care, rather than pushing you away because of your medical bills. It's also impressive to see how you can challenge your own initial thoughts and come up with more compassionate interpretations. Remember, we sometimes tend to perceive situations more negatively than they actually are, especially when we are under stress. Holding onto these alternative possibilities might help to alleviate some of your guilt and worry. Even during challenging moments, always remember to show the same kindness and understanding to yourself that you show to others.",
893,Catastrophizing,"My flight to Alaska was cancelled, the plane must have crashed and everyone died.",I am really anxious and worried right now. My flight to Alaska got cancelled and my mind is immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario. I can't help but think that the plane must have crashed and that everyone on board has died. It's overwhelming and I don't know how to calm down.,"I understand that the cancellation of your flight has caused you a lot of distress. It's important to remember that your thoughts are not facts. Your flight was cancelled, yes - but that does not necessarily mean a plane crash occurred. It could be a variety of reasons. Try to separate these thoughts from the factual situation.","You're right. I understand that I'm catastrophizing and imagining the worst possible scenario. I'm trying to separate the facts from my thoughts. But it isn't easy, and these thoughts still make me feel very anxious.","Yes, I can see how these thoughts are causing you distress. Let's try to brainstorm other possibilities for the cancellation, beyond the worst-case scenario. Could there have been technical issues with the plane? A scheduling error? Can you think of any other reasons why a flight might be cancelled?","Okay, you're right. There are many reasons a flight could get cancelled. Maybe there were mechanical issues with the airplane and it wasn't safe to fly. Or it could be a staff shortage, or bad weather conditions making it unsafe to take off. It certainly helps to think about other possible reasons rather than immediately assuming the worst.","That's great progress! By identifying other plausible reasons for your flight cancellation, you're challenging your initial catastrophic thinking. It's quite common for flights to be cancelled due to mechanical issues, staff shortages, or poor weather conditions. It doesn't always mean something tragic has happened. Try to hold onto these reasonable thoughts when you start to feel overwhelmed and anxious. Remember, our thoughts are not always representative of reality.",
894,Should statements,"I dropped out of college, but got enough credits in my eyes. They should give me a degree.","I dropped out of college, but I believe I still obtained enough credits to deserve a degree.","I understand that you're feeling frustrated because you didn't receive a degree even though you believe you earned enough credits. To separate the situation and your thought, let's consider this - the situation is you dropped out of college, and your thought is that you should still get a degree because of the credits you earned. Is that correct?","Yes, that is correct. I dropped out, but I still worked hard and took many credits. I feel like it's unfair that I didn't get a degree.","I hear you, it sounds frustrating, but let's try to think of it from another perspective. Although you didn't finish and obtain the degree, imagine other possibilities. Could the situation possibly mean you have flexibility to return to college in the future since you've already earned several credits? Could it also mean that even though you don't currently hold a degree, you still have obtained significant knowledge and experience through the courses you completed? Even without the paper proof, could you still apply and demonstrate these skills in the job market? How else might you interpret this situation?","Yes, I suppose you're right. No one can take away the knowledge and skills I've gained from the courses I completed. Even without a degree, this might still be valuable in a job setting. Also, having some credits, I could potentially return and finish my degree in the future if I decided that's what I want to do. I hadn't really considered these options before, they do offer a different perspective.","I'm really impressed with your ability to see this situation in a new light. You're absolutely right - the knowledge and skills you've gained are yours and can certainly be valuable in a job setting. And yes, having already earned some credits gives you a head start if you decide to return to college in the future. Try to hold on to these positive perspectives. Remember that there are multiple ways to reach any goal and there's no one ""right"" path. You have options and this obstacle could just be a stepping stone towards figuring out what you really want. Keep exploring alternative perspectives like this. It can help you handle challenging situations with more resilience and positivity. ",
895,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,"My favorite food is steak because I like meat, but I have a feeling I will choke on the food","I have this recurring thought that whenever I eat my favorite food, which happens to be steak, I am going to choke on it.","It seems like there's a fear tied to eating steak which is your favorite food. Here's what we can see: The situation is you eating a steak. The thought you have attached to it is the fear of choking. It's important to remember that these are two separate things - the act of eating the steak and the fear or thought of choking.
",Thank you for pointing out the distinction between my action and my fear. I understand that they are two separate things and that thought doesn't have to be linked with my action. It's just quite hard to separate them when the fear seems so real in my mind.,"I understand your fear seems incredibly real and it's hard to detach from it, but it's a great step that you've recognized your fear is separate from the actual action of eating the steak. Now, let's think of other possible outcomes from this situation. What else could possibly happen when you're eating steak? Let's aim for both positive and neutral possibilities.","Well, I could simply enjoy the steak, savoring the flavors because it's my favorite food. Or, I could just have a normal meal without any issues. I could also feel content and satisfied after having a good meal. It's true, not all outcomes are negative. I just need to remind myself of these other possibilities.","You've done a fantastic job at identifying positive and neutral outcomes when eating your favorite food, steak. It's true, you could simply enjoy it, savor the flavors, and feel satisfied afterward. Remember, our thoughts do not dictate our reality. The fear of choking is just a thought, and as you've brilliantly pointed out, there are many other possible outcomes. Keep this reframe in mind, and allow yourself to enjoy your meal without fear. Your bravery in confronting your fears is truly commendable.",

Let's try to separate your discomfort about the chair and your overall experience at your new job, what are the other aspects of this job that you're feeling or thinking about?","Apart from the chair, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with the new responsibilities. I'm also having a hard time familiarizing myself with the office layout, and I miss my old colleagues. But I've always dreamed of this opportunity to work at Google, and I really enjoy the projects I'm working on. But still, every time I move on the squeaky chair, it distracts me and irritates me.","It's fantastic you're enjoying the projects and have always dreamed of working at Google, but it's natural to feel overwhelmed with new responsibilities and miss old colleagues. Considering the chair issue, have you thought about exploring some other possibilities like talking to your manager or the HR department about the problem with the chair? They might be able to provide you with a better one. Remember you can also ask for help from your new colleagues in terms of getting to know your work surroundings. Trying to see things from different perspectives can be a helpful strategy. What other solutions can you think of given the circumstances?","You're right, maybe I'm focusing too much on the negatives. I can request for a chair replacement or maybe bring in an ergonomic chair of my own. I could also take this as an opportunity to interact more with my new coworkers, maybe they can help me navigate the new work environment better. I should also give myself more time to adjust to the new responsibilities, I usually pick up things fast. Thank you, I'm beginning to feel less overwhelmed now.","That's a great step forward! Recognizing the situation's challenges and coming up with proactive solutions shows your adaptability and resilience. Remember, it's perfectly fine to feel overwhelmed when faced with new circumstances. Take your time, reach out for help when needed and most importantly, focus on the aspects that you enjoy about your work. By doing so, you'll find that adapting to this new environment will happen more naturally. It can also be helpful to remember - a squeaky chair is a small price to pay for the opportunity to work on your dream projects at Google!",

I was really looking forward to getting some ice cream, and it feels like they should have stayed open just for me.","I can see you're upset, and it's completely understandable to feel this way. Let's focus first on the situation. The ice cream shop closed earlier than expected. Your thoughts about this situation are that they should have stayed open just for you, correct?","Yes, that's correct. I just felt like my needs and wishes weren't considered at all. It feels like they don't care about their customers.","I understand your feelings are hurt. However, can we look at the situation from a different angle? For instance, can we think of possible reasons why the shop might have closed early that doesn't necessarily mean they don't value their customers?","Yes, I guess there could have been a number of reasons why they closed early. Maybe they had an emergency, or there was a problem with their equipment, or perhaps they just had a slower day and decided to close early to save on costs. It doesn't necessarily mean they don't care about their customers or me in particular.","Absolutely, you've got it! There could be many reasons for them closing early that are unrelated to how they value their customers. It's valid to feel frustrated when expectations aren't met, but it's also important to remember situations often aren't personal. Let's not let this isolated event ruin your love for ice cream. Remember, a disappointing moment does not define your overall experience. Keep looking forward to that ice cream next time!",

It's great that you're passionate about your team. However, let's try to separate the Raptors' performance from your personal happiness. Their loss doesn't necessarily dictate your overall mood or sense of hope, does it?","No, their loss doesn't dictate my overall mood, but it does affect me as I am a passionate supporter. But, I understand what you mean. I need to separate their performance from my emotions.","Thank you for understanding. Now, let's consider some other perspectives. Even though your team lost, can you think of any positives that have come out of the game? What if their loss is an opportunity for them to learn and improve, increasing their chances of future success? Could this loss bring the team and their supporters closer together, molding a resilient spirit?","You're right, their loss could be a chance for them to learn from their mistakes. And I guess it does bring the supporters together, as we share in the disappointment but continue to support them regardless. It is a different way to think about it, but it gives a brighter perspective, thank you.","I'm glad you're seeing things from a new perspective. You're absolutely right that losses can foster learning and strengthen the bond between supporters. Remember, the journey to success is seldom straightforward, and these low points might just make eventual victory even sweeter. It's a testament to your enthusiasm and loyalty as a fan that you keep supporting the Raptors through ups and downs.

It's important, though, to separate the situation - the perceived decline in reading - from your thoughts and feelings about that situation. You're worried about diminishing readers, but is that worry based on definitive facts or is it a perception you've formed yourself?","I suppose you're right, it's more of my perception formed by discussions and trends I've been noticing around me. I haven't actually done any definitive research or seen concrete data to confirm my fears. It's just this creeping sense of dread that my hard work won't be appreciated in the future.","I appreciate your honesty. Since we've identified that your fears might not be completely grounded in facts, let's consider other potential outcomes of the situation. Can you think of any possibilities where people might still be able to appreciate your work, even if traditional book reading is on the decline? For example, could your writing reach audiences through different mediums, or cater to the dedicated readers who do still exist? Is it possible that new techniques or technology could breathe life back into the industry?","You know, that's a perspective I hadn't really thought about. I suppose there are more mediums now for sharing my writing work than just traditional books. With the growth in digital platforms, there might be different ways for audiences to engage with my content. And you're right, there will always be dedicated readers who appreciate good writing. I think I've been so fixated on the fear of decline that it's been hard to see potential opportunities. The thoughts about the changing industry are sparking some excitement in me now.","That's an exciting revelation!

However, your thought is that because you are good at these subjects, everyone else should be as well. Is that right? Now, why do you think it's causing you stress?","Yes, that's correct. I think it's causing me stress because I feel like others are not trying hard enough to be good at these subjects, or sometimes I feel superior because I perform well in these areas. This thought process makes me feel guilty and causes tension in my relationships.","I see, your perspective about being superior is creating tension. Can we explore other ways to interpret this situation? For instance, have you considered that people have different strengths and talents in different areas? Maybe their interests and skills lie in other fields, outside of math and science. Or perhaps they have unique methods of learning or they may not have as much time to dedicate to these subjects. Could these be possibilities?","Yes, those could be possibilities that I haven't considered. I guess I've just been so focused on my own skills and success, that I forgot we all have unique talents and strengths in different areas.

Thank you for helping me see these other perspectives.","I'm really glad to hear you recognizing those alternative perspectives. Each person indeed has their own unique paths and different ways to shine. It's important we don't measure other people's abilities based on our own strengths.

So, you're linking the quality of these photos to the idea of being a terrible photographer, is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I feel like my skills are not good enough and it makes me really depressed.","I see where you're coming from, but let's look at this from a different angle. Could there be other reasons why some photos did not turn out as expected? It might not necessarily mean you're a bad photographer. For instance, maybe the lighting wasn't great, or the subjects were moving too quickly? Could the equipment have been part of the problem?","You're right, some of these factors might have contributed. But I still feel like I should have been able to overcome these issues with better skills.","I really appreciate your willingness to consider different factors that might have affected your photos. It's true that more skills can help in handling challenging conditions. But remember, even the most experienced photographers encounter these issues. It's a valuable part of learning and improvement. Don't get discouraged. Keep practicing, learnings will come and your skills will improve over time. You are not defined by a set of photos which did not turn out as you hoped. You are on a journey of growth and every challenge is a stepping stone to becoming a better photographer.",
902,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I'm in the navy. I am afraid I'll die during the training,I'm in the navy and I can't help but feel terrified that I might die during the training. The constant pressure and rigorous physical demands make me question my ability to handle the situation and the thought of not making it through is overwhelming.,"It sounds like you're going through a lot right now with navy training. It is important for us to understand that these are two separate things: the objective fact which is your navy training with its rigorous physical demands, and your thoughts or fears about not being able to handle the situation or potentially dying. Fear can often distort our perception of reality.","That's right. I have realized that my fear seems to be distorting my perception of the situation. Despite understanding that it's rigorous, I think I am focusing too much on the potential negative outcome rather than averting my thoughts to doing my best and making it through. I want to overcome this fear.","I'm glad to hear you're recognizing the impact your fear is having on your perception. Now, let's think about other possibilities. What if instead of focusing on the fear of negative outcomes, you focused on the growth and strength you're gaining from this rigorous training? Or perhaps the relationships and camaraderie you're building with your fellow navy personnel? Or maybe even thinking about the skills you're acquiring that could be beneficial in the future? Could these be possible alternative perspectives for you?","Yes, I think that could make a big difference. I haven't been appreciating the strength and growth that the training is offering me, or the relationships I'm building with my colleagues, which has been significantly positive. I can also see how the skills I'm gaining can be beneficial beyond my navy service. Maybe I need to start viewing this training as a series of challenges that I can overcome, rather than a potential risk to my life. I appreciate this alternative perspective.","I'm really proud of the progress and insight you've shown in this conversation. You're right – viewing your training as a source of growth, camaraderie, and valuable skills is such a healthy perspective. Try to remind yourself of these positive aspects whenever you find yourself caught in negative thoughts. Your training is indeed a series of challenges, but remember, each challenge you overcome makes you stronger and more resilient. Keep going, you're doing a great job.",
903,Catastrophizing,I like to go to the creek when I drink. I am going to fall in and drown.,"I often find solace in going to the creek and having a drink. It helps me relax and escape from the stress of daily life. However, lately, I've been having this irrational fear that I might fall into the creek and drown. It's been bothering me and making it difficult for me to enjoy this activity that I used to find so calming.","I see, it sounds like you're dealing with two things here. One is your relaxing ritual of going to the creek and having a drink. The other is an on-going fear that has come up recently about falling into the creek. Does that sound right to you?","Yes, that's correct. This fear has been a new development and it's starting to affect the peace and solace I found at the creek. I don't understand why I'm suddenly afraid of something I've been doing for a long time.","It's completely normal to develop unexplained fears, but sometimes they can be linked to underlying concerns. I'm wondering, could there be other factors at play here? Maybe this fear of falling in isn't literal, perhaps it's a symbol for something else going on. Could it be stress from other areas of life, or a response to change? Let's try to find some different ways to look at this situation.","You might be right. Actually, I've been feeling a lot more stressed at work lately. Deadlines have become tighter and the workload increased quite a bit. I've been feeling like I'm losing control, like I'm on the edge of falling. I guess this could be projecting onto my time at the creek. It used to be my escape from all of that, but lately it seems that I can't even escape my stress there.","I appreciate you diving deeper into your feelings and identifying how other stresses in your life might be creeping into your peaceful creek time. You're doing a fantastic job at understanding your emotions. Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed. Our emotions often find ways to express themselves. It's great that you've found this link. Now, let's work on managing your stress and reframing your thoughts to regain that sense of control both at work and during your creek visits. You're capable of handling this.",
904,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I'm on a diet. I slipped up and ate some candy this morning. I'm a failure and my diet is ruined.,"I'm on a diet, but this morning I slipped up and ate some candy. Now I'm feeling like a failure and I think my whole diet is ruined.","I can see why eating candy might make you feel like you've ruined your diet. But, let's just clarify the situation here. You're on a diet, and you happened to eat some candy this morning. Is that correct? Now, could you help me understand how this one incident led you to feel like a failure and draw a conclusion that your whole diet is ruined?","Yes, you're correct. I'm supposed to be eating really healthy foods and I've been trying so hard to stick to my diet. I indulged in some candy this morning which I shouldn't have and now I feel like I've lost control. That's why I feel like a failure and believe I might have ruined my diet.","I see where you're coming from, but remember, everybody has moments when they slip up, it's part of being human. Could it also be possible that you're being a bit harsh on yourself? Instead of looking at it as a failure, could we perhaps think of more encouraging perspectives? Like, what if this incident was just a small bump in your ongoing journey towards healthy eating? Or could this situation be a reminder of why it's important for you to stick to your diet plan? What other possibilities are there that we might think about?","You're right, maybe I am being too harsh on myself. Instead of being a failure, this could just be a small stumble. I guess this could be an opportunity to remind myself of why I started dieting in the first place and to learn from this to make better choices in the future. Maybe this isn't as bad as I initially thought and doesn't have to mean my entire diet is ruined.","That's a great consolidation of thoughts. It is indeed a small stumble and not a sign of failure. Use this as a stepping stone to reinforce your commitment to healthy eating. Remind yourself why you started dieting and learn how to manage these situations better in the future. It's important to remember that one mistake doesn't invalidate all the hard work you've done till now. Success in dieting, like many other things in life, is not about never making mistakes but about how we recover from them. Keep your determination strong and move forward.

905,Discounting the positive,I take a week off once a year for vacation but i never have a good time because i get sunburned at the beach.,"I take a week off once a year for vacation, but I never have a good time because I always end up getting sunburned at the beach. It's frustrating because I look forward to this time off, but it just ends up being painful and uncomfortable.",It seems like you're combining your vacation time with the inevitably getting sunburned. It's important to remember that these are two separate things - your annual vacation and the risk of getting sunburned.,"You're absolutely right. When I think about it that way, I realize I have been conflating the two. I suppose my vacation is not inherently linked to getting sunburned, it's my activities during the vacation that are the problem.","That's a great realization! So, thinking about it this way, what are some other possibilities or activities you might consider for your vacation that could potentially help you avoid getting sunburned?","Well, I suppose I could try going to places that don't require me to be out in the sun too much. Perhaps I could go on a city exploration trip or visit some museums. I could also plan indoor activities or go on a vacation during a cooler season. I guess I've just been so stuck on the idea that a vacation should be at the beach that I've failed to consider the many other options I have.",That's an amazing breakthrough! Finding new indoor activities or exploring cities can indeed be equally relaxing and enjoyable. The fact that you are now expanding your horizons and considering different possibilities shows how adaptable you are. I believe these new holiday ideas have the potential to make your once-a-year vacation a more enjoyable and comfortable experience. Why not start planning a unique vacation away from the beach this year?,
906,Catastrophizing,i'm traveling to paris this year for my vacation. The plane will probably crash and I'll die.,"I'm feeling really anxious about my upcoming trip to Paris. I can't shake the feeling that something terrible is going to happen, like the plane crashing and me dying.","I understand you are anxious about your upcoming trip. Let's try to separate the situation from your thought. The situation is: you are going on a trip to Paris. Now, can you describe the thought that is causing you to be anxious separately?","Sure. The thought that is making me anxious is that the plane I'll be traveling in might crash, causing me to possibly die in the incident.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, let's try exploring other possibilities within the same situation. What are some other outcomes that could result from this flight to Paris? They don't all have to be positive, but let's think about a range of scenarios.","Of course. Well, the plane could arrive safely and I could have an amazing trip exploring the sights and experiencing the culture in Paris. There may be some turbulence during the flight, which may be frightening but not dangerous. Or, the flight might be delayed or cancelled due to bad weather. Lastly, there might be travel restrictions due to sudden global issues, forcing me to postpone my plans.","Thank you for exploring these alternative possibilities. It's great to see you considering a range of outcomes, from exciting adventures in Paris to potential travel interruptions, all of which are far more common than a plane crash. It's completely normal to feel anxious about flying, but remember that flying is statistically safer than most other forms of travel. Let's focus on the positive experiences you mentioned: visiting new places and immersing yourself in a different culture, which can be really enriching and enjoyable. Try not to let your fear rob you of the excitement of your travel plans.",
907,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,My boyfriend dumped me. I am sure he does not want to deal with my bipolar disorder.,I feel devastated right now because my boyfriend just broke up with me. I can't help but feel like it's because of my bipolar disorder. I think he just doesn't want to deal with the challenges that come with being in a relationship with someone who has a mental illness.,"I understand that you're going through a tough time right now with your breakup. However, remember that it's essential not to immediately link the breakup with your bipolar disorder. Maybe there are other reasons. Can you try to think of any other possible reasons that might have led to your breakup?","You're right, I guess I'm just blaming it on my disorder because it's the easiest thing to do. Maybe there were other reasons. We did argue quite a bit and sometimes about trivial things. Maybe we just weren't as compatible as we thought we were. Is it possible that my bipolar disorder might have just been a part of a bigger problem?","Absolutely, it's very possible that differences and frequent disagreements contributed to the breakup, and it's not solely related to your bipolar disorder. Often, relationships end because of compatibility problems, communication issues or differing expectations. Even though bipolar disorder can create challenges in a relationship, it doesn't automatically mean it's the direct cause of the breakup. Do you think other factors or issues could have played a part in it, beyond the disagreements and your bipolar disorder?","Actually, when I reflect on it, definitely other things may have contributed to our split. We had very different life goals. He wanted to settle down soon and I'm not ready for that level of commitment. My desire to travel and probably my need for more independence were more pressing than I realized. Also, I think we failed in understanding each other's ways of expressing love and affection. Maybe it wasn't just about my bipolar disorder but a combination of all these things.","I'm really proud of you for reflecting deeply on this and recognizing other factors that may have contributed to the end of your relationship. Your differing life goals, communication styles, and understanding of expressing love are all significant elements in a relationship. It's crucial to remember that no single aspect defines us entirely or determines the outcome of a situation. You're so much more than your bipolar disorder, and it’s definitely not the sole reason for the breakup. It’s understandable to feel upset right now, but please remember that this breakup could also be a new opportunity for you to find someone more compatible with your life goals and needs in the future. You are deserving of a relationship where you are understood, valued, and loved for all your facets.",
908,Personalization,My cats are sick it's because I am a horrible owner.,I have been feeling really guilty and upset lately because my cats have been sick. I can't help but feel like it's all my fault and that I am a terrible owner.,"It sounds like you're going through a tough time with your cats being sick and you're blaming yourself for that. Can we try separating the fact that your cats are sick, from your thoughts about being a terrible owner?","Yes, I suppose I can try. I feel awful about them being unwell and I realize that doesn't necessarily mean I'm a terrible owner. Maybe I'm just blaming myself because it's easier than accepting that sometimes, things just happen.","That's a helpful realization. Now let's think about some other possibilities. Despite your initial thoughts, in the same situation, could there be other reasons why your cats are sick? Perhaps something environmental or due to a change in their food or it's simply something out of your control? It's also possible that you've taken good care of them but they unfortunately got sick, isn't it?","Yes, I suppose you're right. We recently moved to a new apartment, so perhaps the change in environment may have affected them. I've continued to feed them the same food they've been used to, but perhaps there could be something else in the apartment that's affecting their health. I've always tried to take good care of them, so it's frustrating to see them still fall ill. But you're right, it's possible and probable that it's simply something out of my control. It's difficult not to shoulder the blame, though.","That's a significant leap in understanding you've made. It's clear you care deeply about your cats and always strive to provide them with the best. The change in environment could indeed be a possible factor in their ailness. Remember, it's only human to feel responsible when our loved ones are not doing well. However, just as with people, there are aspects of a cat’s health that, despite our best efforts, are simply beyond our control. It's a tough situation for sure, but it doesn't define you as an owner. Dealing with these feelings may take time, but try not to be too hard on yourself. Take steps to get them the best help you can, and remember that you're doing your best.",
909,Overgeneralization,I am not good with fashion choices. I don't think I will do well as a fashion designer.,"I have been thinking a lot lately, and I've come to realize that I am not very good when it comes to making fashion choices. This has made me doubt my ability to succeed as a fashion designer. I constantly second-guess myself and it's really affecting my confidence in pursuing my passion.",I see that you are doubting your abilities because of your perceived weakness in making fashion choices. But would it be possible to separate your current situation from the thought that you are not capable of being a successful fashion designer? Could there be other factors affecting the situation as well?,"You're right. It could be a plethora of other factors affecting my ability to make fashion choices. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately, so maybe I’m not thinking clearly. And, I also understand that I’m still learning and have room to grow. Maybe I shouldn't judge my entire potential based on my current situation.","Well articulated. Considering you're still learning and your current stress levels, it's understandable that this might be a temporary phase. Yet, have you thought about other possibilities? Like, perhaps you're unique in your style and interpretations or maybe you can learn from others, seek guidance from a mentor, or further your skills through training classes. What other possibilities can you think of under this same situation?
","That's an interesting point of view. Maybe I have been comparing my designs to what is traditionally popular in the fashion industry and this has led me to believe that I lack talent. But, perhaps my unique style can work to my advantage if I present it to the right people or market. Additionally, I've been trying to learn everything on my own. Maybe seeking help or going for training wouldn't be such a bad idea, it should definitely aid in polishing my skills. And yes, finding a mentor in the fashion industry could provide great insights and industry knowledge, it might just be the support I need to grow.","You have successfully turned a challenging situation into an opportunity for growth and learning. Your unique style can indeed be your strength in an industry that thrives on distinction and creativity. Seeking help from a mentor or further training can help you gain deeper insights and strengthen your skills. Remember, self-doubt is common, especially in creative fields, but do not let it overshadow your potential and passion. Keep exploring different avenues and persevering in your pursuit of becoming a successful fashion designer. Your journey in the industry is just beginning, and there's so much still to be discovered and accomplished. Keep going!",
910,Discounting the positive,"I graduated top of my class in college, but it's a small school and not that impressive.","I graduated top of my class in college, but it's a small school and not that impressive. I feel like my achievements aren't as significant as they could have been if I had attended a bigger or more prestigious institution. It's been bothering me because I put in a lot of effort and hard work, and now I wonder if it was all for nothing.","It sounds like you're conflating your school's size with the value of your personal achievements. Let's try to separate these two. You studying diligently and graduating top of your class is a fact. Now, remember it's the perception of where you did this that is causing you distress. Everyone's path is unique and it doesn't make your achievements any less important. Do you think there could be a different way to look at this?","You're right, perhaps I have been looking at this the wrong way. Perhaps the value of my achievement isn't determined by the size or prestige of the institution I attended, but by the effort and dedication I put into my studies. The fact that I graduated top of my class demonstrates my commitment and drive, which are significant achievements in themselves, regardless of where they were accomplished. I should be proud of my achievements instead of downplaying them.","That's a great start! Recognising your commitment and drive is so important. Now, let's take that a step further: Can you think of any additional benefits or advantages that your experience at a smaller school may have provided? This could actually turn into a unique strength.","You're correct. Now that I reflect on it, my experience at a smaller school gave me opportunities to form close-knit relationships with my professors and other students. It provided an environment where everyone knew each other and that fostered a comfortable and highly interactive learning experience. I got to be a more active participant in my education which may have not been possible in a larger institution. This personalized attention could have even played a part in my academic success. It is indeed a unique strength. I need to start considering these aspects as well.","Absolutely, recognizing the value of your unique educational journey is crucial. You've worked hard and made the most of the opportunities presented to you, which is a manifestation of your resourcefulness and adaptability. These are qualities that will serve you well in any future endeavors. Keep in mind that success isn't determined only by the prestige of the institution one attends, but largely by personal drive, ambition, and adaptability - all of which you clearly possess. Embrace your achievements and the qualities that got you there, they're truly significant.",
911,Discounting the positive,"I love to draw. I got my favorite character right once, but I must've just been lucky.","I love to draw and it brings me joy. But sometimes, I doubt my skills and the success I achieve, thinking that maybe it was just luck when I created my favorite drawing of a character.","It sounds like you're really passionate about drawing but are having some doubts about your abilities. Can we try to separate the action of drawing from this feeling of self-doubt? It might be helpful to consider that creating your favorite drawing and your thoughts about it possibly being just luck, are two distinct things.",That's a really interesting perspective. I never thought of separating the action of drawing from my feelings of self-doubt. I'm always so caught up in questioning my abilities that I didn't realize they're not necessarily linked. I'd like to learn how to appreciate my art independent of these doubts.,"That's a great insight! Now, let's consider some alternative interpretations of your situation. Could it be that the success you've achieved with your drawing isn't due to luck, but instead a result of your passion and practice? Perhaps self-doubt is a common experience for artists, and maybe it's a sign that you're growing in your skills and pushing boundaries rather than just being lucky? How about if we see your self-doubt as a way of you pushing yourself to improve, rather than as an indicator of your lack of skill? What other possibilities can you think of?","You're right, I hadn't considered those points. I agree, maybe it's not just about luck but more about the time and effort I've dedicated to my art. It can be scary pushing boundaries as I develop my skills, and maybe I'm mistaking this fear for lack of talent. I suppose another possibility could be that I'm too critical of my own work. I tend to compare myself to professional artists instead of acknowledging my growth and improvements over time.","That's a wonderful self-realization! Progress and growth can be slow and sometimes unnoticeable, especially when we're constantly advancing our skills. It's understandable to have fears and doubts, particularly when challenging ourselves beyond our comfort zones. However, remember that every artist has their unique journey, and it's crucial to focus on your self-improvement rather than comparing yourself to professionals. You've clearly dedicated a great deal of time and effort to refine your talent, and it's crucial that your self-evaluation reflects that fact. Continue channeling your doubts into motivation to grow, because your passion and dedication are the true drivers of your success.",
912,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I really want to go to college but it is so expensive. I will never save enough money.,"I have been wanting to go to college for a long time, but I have been feeling discouraged because it is so expensive. It seems impossible for me to save enough money to afford it.",I understand your concern about the cost of college education. Let's separate the situation here. The situation is you wanting to go to college and the thought is you being unable to afford it. Is that accurate?,"Yes, that's accurate. I truly desire to get a college education, but the financial aspect is causing me a lot of stress and fear. I can't help but think that I will never be able to save enough money for it.","I can understand your worry about finances. However, let's explore some options. Have you considered looking into scholarships, grants, or work-study programs? There are also many community organizations and employers who provide tuition assistance. There might be more possibilities to finance your education than you initially thought.
","I've thought about scholarships and grants, but it seems like those are so competitive. The idea of work-study programs or employer-provided tuition assistance seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure where to start or if I'll even qualify for them. It seems a little overwhelming.","I hear you, it can absolutely feel overwhelming when considering these options. It's great that you can see the potential of them - that's already a big step! Remember that many people face similar challenges and rest assured that there are resources available to guide you on how to apply for these programs. Even if the scholarships and grants seem competitive, every awarded scholarship started with an application. You might be more qualified than you think. Take it one step at a time, start researching, and reach out to those who can assist you in this process. It might be a challenging journey but it's not an impossible one. You have more strengths and options than you're giving yourself credit for. You can do this!",
913,Labeling and mislabeling,I forgot to feed Maddie. I am such a bad pet owner.,I feel really guilty and upset because I forgot to feed Maddie. I can't believe I failed as a pet owner.,"I see that you're feeling guilty because you forgot to feed Maddie. It's important to remember that this was only one incident. So, what were the circumstances that led you to forget about feeding Maddie? Could there be external factors at play here?","Yes, I was extremely caught up with work pressures yesterday and just lost track of time. I already feel like I'm failing at my job, this incident with Maddie makes me feel like I'm failing at home too.","It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure at work. Let's try looking at the situation with Maddie from a different perspective. Could there possibly be other interpretations to this situation? Like you were overwhelmed with work and it's not normal for you to act this way? Or could it be seen as an indication to manage your time or workload better? How can you view this situation in a constructive way instead? You're not failing, but rather, what can this incident teach you?","You're right. I'm usually good at managing my time and feeding Maddie has always been a part of my routine. This incident is not a regular occurrence, it was an exception because I was overwhelmed with work yesterday. Maybe it's a good time to reassess my workload and try to manage my time more efficiently. This doesn't necessarily mean that I'm a failure, I just need to handle my work pressures better.","That's absolutely right. It is indeed heartening to see that you're able to reassess the situation and take a more constructive view. You're not a failure, in fact, you've always taken good care of Maddie. Recognize that everyone can make mistakes, especially when burdened with work-related stress. The incident with Maddie provides an opportunity to reassess your current workload and make meaningful changes that would benefit both your professional and personal life. You have the strength within you to manage these pressures, while remaining a wonderful pet owner. Keep going!",

I bet because I'm the new employee they are going to make me go get coffee for everyone.,I started my new job at Google last week. I bet because I'm the new employee they are going to make me go get coffee for everyone. I feel quite anxious and worried about this possibility. It makes me feel like I won't be taken seriously or valued as a valuable member of the team.,"I understand where you're coming from. It sounds like you're feeling anxious due to the thought that you might be asked to do tasks that feel demeaning to you. Let's separate the situation from what you're thinking. In reality, you've started a new job at Google, a great achievement. However, the thought worrying you is that you might have to fetch coffee for everyone which may lead to you being undervalued. That’s the thought we need to look at in more depth.","Right, I see. The situation is that I have a new job at Google, and the thought that I'm struggling with is about being asked to fetch coffee for everyone which would lead to feeling undervalued and not taken seriously.","That's a great reflection! You've separated the situation from your thoughts. I invite you now to think about other possible scenarios related to your new job. For instance, might there be other tasks you would be asked to do as a new hire? What kinds of professional growth opportunities could exist for you? Or perhaps, the team appreciates everyone's contribution and treats coffee fetching as a shared responsibility? Brainstorming these possibilities can help us replace that initial thought with other, more positive and realistic scenarios. Can you think of any such possibilities?","Yes, you're right. It's possible I could be asked to do other tasks that would actually contribute to the growth of my capabilities. It might be research-related tasks, brainstorming in new projects or even presenting my own work in team meetings. This could give me the opportunity to prove my worth. It’s also possible that they don’t discriminate based on hierarchy and everyone takes turns fetching coffee or perhaps they have specific cafeteria staff for such chores. I suppose realizing these possibilities can make me feel less concerned about being undervalued.","That's fantastic, you've done an impressive job at reimagining the situation and generating productive alternatives! This reflects your ability to grow professionally and contribute significantly to your new role at Google. Remember, everyone begins somewhere and every task you undertake, big or small, is a step towards your professional growth. It's healthy and beneficial to approach your job with these reframed thoughts. Don't forget that everyone in a team is valuable. Keep up the good work and positive thinking!",
915,Discounting the positive,"My wife loved the haircut I got on our dog and thanked me for it, but all I did was take her to the groomers.","I can't help but feel guilty and a bit dishonest when my wife thanked me for the haircut I got on our dog. The truth is, I just took her to the groomers and didn't actually do anything myself. It's like she's giving me credit for something I didn't do.","It sounds like you're feeling a heavy sense of guilt over your wife's praise. It's important, however, to separate the situation from the emotion. You took a step to get the dog groomed, but didn't actually do the grooming yourself. Can you think of other perspectives to this situation?","Well, when I think about it, I suppose I did contribute by getting the dog to the groomers and back. I guess I could think of it as facilitating the process rather than actually doing the grooming. Maybe she was just grateful for the effort I put into handling the logistics.","That's a good start in reframing your thoughts. Yes, you facilitated the process. And remember, organizing and taking the dog to the groomer does require effort. Is there any other way you might view your role in this situation? Could your wife possibly have been thankful for something else associated with this?","Perhaps she was just overall happy with the end result and appreciated that I made sure our dog was groomed and looked nice. Or maybe she was grateful that I took care of it so she didn't have to worry about it. Despite not having done the grooming myself, I did play a part in making it happen.","Excellent job reframing your perspective! It's key to acknowledge even the logistical parts you took care of as they contribute to the end result. Your actions also ensured that your wife had one less thing to worry about. So, my advice to you is to embrace this as a collective success. You took responsibility which in turn made things easier for your wife. Always remember, every effort, big or small, plays a significant role in achieving a result.",

It's my favorite food, but I can't help but think that it's going to have a negative impact on my health and lead to an early death.","I see that you love pizza but you're worried about its impact on your health. Let's try to separate the situation here: You love eating pizza, that's one part. But on the other side, you worry it might negatively affect your health. You see these two parts, right?","Yes, I do see both of these parts. I enjoy the flavor of pizza, it's comfort food for me. But at the same time I understand that it's not exactly the healthiest option and the thought that I might be putting my health at risk is frightening.","That's really insightful. Now that we have separated the situation, let's brainstorm some possibilities. Could there be alternatives that allow you to enjoy pizza, perhaps a healthier version or in moderation, without increasing risks to your health? What do you think?","That's a good idea. Maybe I could look for pizzas with healthier ingredients or even homemade options that I can control. I could also try to limit the times I eat pizza, maybe turn it into a once in a week or month treat instead of a constant go-to food. This could help balance my love for pizza and not compromise my health.","You've just demonstrated a great ability to reframe your thoughts and brainstorm solutions well. Your idea of finding healthier pizza alternatives or making it a treat instead of a staple food is really valuable. This could be a key step towards not only enjoying what you love but also maintaining your health. Remember, moderation is often the key. Pizza is not necessarily harmful if enjoyed in balance. Your thoughts and behaviors have a direct impact on your health, so this balanced approach to food can be really beneficial. That's an excellent reframing of the situation!",
917,Discounting the positive,"I learn a lot watching videos of surgeries being performed, but I'm sure anyone else could learn just as much.","I've been spending a lot of time watching videos of surgeries being performed. I find them really fascinating and I feel like I'm learning a lot from them. But sometimes, I can't help but wonder if anyone else could learn just as much from watching those videos.","It's great that you are expanding your knowledge through surgery videos. Now let's distinguish between your fascination and learning experience with these videos, and your thoughts on whether others might learn from them too.","Yes, you're right. Even though I really enjoy watching these surgery videos and feel like I'm gaining a lot from them, my thoughts about other people learning from them are actually separate from my own experience. It doesn't necessarily matter if others could learn from them, what matters is that I'm learning and benefiting from it.","It's important to recognize how much you're gaining personally from watching these videos. Now, think about this: could there be people who wouldn't learn as much from these videos? Or could there be other means through which people gain a similar level of knowledge and fascination?
","Well, when I think about it, not everyone has the same interests as me. Some people might not enjoy or grasp the complexity of surgeries from these videos. And surely, there are countless other ways for people to learn and become fascinated by something. I suppose my initial thoughts were somewhat rooted in a comparison with others, rather than focusing on my own individual learning journey.",Absolutely! Everyone is unique in their learning styles and interests. It's great that you can acknowledge that others might have different areas or methods of learning. The crucial thing is what you have grasped from these videos and how they fascinate you—it's your personal learning journey that matters. That doesn't diminish the fact that these videos may not resonate the same way with others. Keep focusing on how these videos contribute to your personal growth.,
918,Personalization,My last date with this new person went terribly and I'm sure it's all my fault for being such a bore.,I recently went on a date with a new person and it went terribly. I can't help but think that it's all my fault for being such a bore.,"It sounds like the date didn't go as you expected and that's upsetting. However, it's important to remember that one event doesn't define your total self. Let's try to separate the event from your personal interpretation. Can you see the date as just one event, rather than a reflection of your entire personality?","I suppose I can try to see it that way. It was really just one date, not a full reflection of who I am as a person. It's just hard not to feel like I'm the reason it didn't go well.","That's a great first step to recognize that one date doesn't define you. Let's engage in ""possible thinking."" Could you highlight some other reasons why the date may not have gone well, that are unrelated to you being a 'bore'? There might be external factors, or maybe about the other person, anything that could have influenced the outcome.","Okay, well, I know the chosen location was a bit loud and crowded, so it wasn't an ideal setting for an intimate conversation. Also, thinking about it now, our interests didn't seem to align very well. He seemed more into sports and outdoor activities, while I am more into arts and literature. Maybe it was just a mismatch of personalities and interests rather than me being boring.","That's really insightful! You were able to identify potential factors that contributed to the situation, like the venue's ambiance and differences in interests. It suggests that you're not 'boring' but perhaps you two were just not as compatible. Remember, everyone has unique personalities and interests. Sometimes, it takes a few tries before we find someone who truly appreciates ours. So, it's absolutely not your fault. Keep being true to yourself and the right person will value you for who you are.",
919,Labeling and mislabeling,I like playing video games because I'm no good at anything else. I'm so worthless I can only push some buttons in front of a TV.,I like playing video games because I'm no good at anything else. I'm so worthless I can only push some buttons in front of a TV.,"I hear you saying that you enjoy playing video games, and I also hear you expressing feelings of worthlessness. Let's try to explore this a bit more. How does playing video games make you feel? Is it necessarily a bad thing to be good at?","Playing video games makes me feel accomplished because it's the one thing I know I'm good at. But, I also know that spending my time in front of a screen won't get me far in life. It's quite conflicting because it's not that it's a bad thing to be good at gaming, but I feel like it's the only thing I'm good at. That's where the feeling of worthlessness comes from.","I see where you're coming from. You're very good at gaming but you're concerned about its value in your life. Gaming actually requires a lot of skill sets - strategic thinking, problem solving, hand-eye coordination to name some. Could there be other areas in your life where you could apply these skills? Or perhaps there are other things you enjoy doing where these skills might be useful? Let's think about other activities you might enjoy or excel at.","Now that you've mentioned it, I realize that I used to enjoy solving puzzles and brain teasers a lot. I also love strategy based board games. While these aren't exactly 'productive', they do stimulate my mind in a similar way to video games. Plus, these activities involve other people, so there's interaction and bonding. Maybe I've been seeing things too one-sidedly. I thought my skills were only useful in gaming, but maybe they're transferable to other areas of my life as well.","That's a great breakthrough! It's very insightful of you to identify that your love for strategic thinking and problem solving doesn't have to be confined within the realm of video games. Both puzzles and strategy board games not only involve similar skills but also provide a social aspect. Remember, productivity isn't always about output or visible achievement. It's also about personal growth, joy, and connection with others. So keep exploring and experimenting with these activities. You might be surprised by your own capacities. What's essential is that you're not defined by one attribute or interest, you're much more multifaceted and valuable than that.",
920,Should statements,"I can't stand beets, but I should love them as an ovovegetarian.","I've been feeling really conflicted lately about my dietary choices as an ovovegetarian. One thing that's been bothering me is that I can't stand beets, but I feel like I should love them because they are considered a staple in a vegetarian diet. It's been weighing on my mind and making me feel guilty.","It sounds like there are two separate things going on here: the reality of your chosen diet, and the thoughts you have about what that diet 'should' look like. Does that sound right to you?","Yes, that actually makes sense. I didn't think about it that way, I thought I had to love all vegetables and stuff but truly, I feel immense pressure to love beets because they are often part of my ovovegetarian diet. There's definitely some guilt associated with it as well.","That's a very honest recognition. Now, let's think about other possibilities. For example, there are hundreds of other types of vegetables and fruits out there. What if your diet could still be balanced and nutritious even without the inclusion of beets? Does the idea of not liking one specific vegetable necessarily mean you're failing at your diet or could it mean that you just have a preference like everyone else? And is it possible to find other ways to cope with the guilt you are feeling?","You're right, I suppose not liking one specific vegetable doesn't mean I'm failing at my diet. It's likely just a preference, as you mentioned. There must be other vegetables or fruits that I can substitute for beets. Also, the guilt is something I need to manage rather than let it overpower my thoughts. It's encouraging to see this from a different perspective.","I'm really glad to hear you say that and I absolutely agree. You've just shown a great ability to reframe your thoughts. It's completely okay to have your own preferences and the guilt you’ve been carrying is not warranted. Incorporate the foods you love into your diet, and always remember, a successful diet is not about forcing specific foods onto yourself, but rather, it’s about enjoying the foods you eat while maintaining nutrition. Keep exploring more possibilities with this open perspective you've found. You are doing great on your journey.",
921,Catastrophizing,I'm often late for class. My teacher will give me a bad grade and I will never graduate.,I'm often late for class. My teacher will give me a bad grade and I will never graduate.,It sounds like you are conflating being late for class with your graduation. So let's try to disentangle these two issues. Is there a direct connection between occasional tardiness and overall success in your studies?,"Well, I believe there may not be a direct link between being late occasionally and my overall success in studies. But, I'm just worried that it could have a negative impact on my final grades.","That's a good point. However, could there be other outcomes apart from getting a poor grade? Maybe your teacher could understand your situation, or you could learn to manage your time better, or perhaps this experience could instill a sense of responsibility in you. What do you think about these possibilities?","You're right, those are possibilities. I hadn't really thought about it that way. My teacher might understand my situation if I explain it to them. And yes, I should definitely work on managing my time better to avoid being late. This could turn into a valuable learning experience for me. I'm starting to see that it may not be as black and white as I initially thought.","I am really impressed with your ability to adopt a different perspective on this. It's great that you are willing to communicate with your teacher and work on improving your time management skills. Remember, our thoughts often shape our reality. By reframing the way you see the situation, you're making a significant step toward turning it into a positive learning experience. Keep thinking flexibly, it's a key aspect of healthy psychological development.

922,Overgeneralization,I changed over to contacts after having glasses when I was younger. I will never be as attractive now as I was then.,"I've been feeling really down lately about switching from glasses to contacts. When I was younger, I used to wear glasses and I felt like I was more attractive back then. I can't help but think that I'll never be as attractive now because of this change. It's really been affecting my self-esteem.","I see. So the situation is that you've changed from wearing glasses to contact lenses. And the thoughts you're having are that this change has made you less attractive, and it's affecting your self-esteem. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I just can't shake the feeling that I was more attractive when I was wearing glasses. I've been getting down on myself a lot because I feel like this change has really affected my looks.","It's completely valid to feel the way you're feeling, but it might help us understand your situation more if we consider other perspectives. For example, could there be people who would consider you just as attractive, or even more attractive wearing contacts as opposed to glasses? Is it also possible that your attractiveness is not solely defined by whether you wear glasses or contacts? Could it be that other facets of your personality contribute to your attractiveness?","You're right. I possibly might be focusing too much on just one aspect of my appearance. It's possible that others might find me just as attractive, or even more so, without the glasses. I suppose my attractiveness isn't only about whether I wear glasses or contacts. There are indeed other aspects of me that could contribute to that, like my personality and character. I think I need to work on shifting the focus and valuing those aspects more. Your words have given me something to ponder.","That's a significant insight, and I'm glad to see you thinking in that direction. Remember, it's our inner qualities like personality and character that truly define our attractiveness, and not just physical attributes. It can be challenging to shift focus, but it's worth trying. You always have the potential to work through this and see yourself in a more holistic and positive light.",
923,Should statements,One food I love to eat is steak. I should be able to cook it better than most chefs.,One food I love to eat is steak. I should be able to cook it better than most chefs.,"It seems like you have a high standard for yourself when it comes to cooking steak. But remember, your value does not depend on whether you cook better than most chefs -- it's important to enjoy the process. Let's seperate the situation - 'enjoying steaks' and your thought - 'should cook better than most chefs'. Are they really inseparable?","No, I suppose they aren't. I enjoy eating steak, and while it would be nice to cook it better than most chefs, my enjoyment of steak isn't diminished if I can't do that. I see now that I may be setting too high a standard on myself unnecessarily.","That's a very insightful realization. Now, let's consider other possibilities. Is it the only way for you to enjoy steak? What other ways might there be to enjoy steak? Maybe it's more about exploring different cooking methods or flavors, recreating a favorite recipe, sharing it with friends or family, etc.?",You're right. It's not only about cooking steak amazingly well. I can also enjoy steak by exploring new recipes or simply savoring the flavor when I eat out at a restaurant. Sharing a beautifully cooked steak with friends and family can also bring me enjoyment. The focus doesn't have to be on me outdoing professional chefs. ,"I am glad to see you're considering these other perspectives! Remember, cooking is more about the joy of the process and the pleasure of sharing it with others than it is about perfection. You don't have to be the best chef to enjoy a good steak. So lower those self-expectations and enjoy your journey with cooking and sharing steak!",
924,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,My co-workers at the factory stopping caring about risk. They will never learn until it's too late.,I've been feeling really frustrated with my co-workers at the factory lately. It seems like they just don't care about safety or the potential risks involved in our work. It's like they never learn from their mistakes and it worries me that they won't realize the consequences until it's too late.,"I see, it's quite clear that safety is a major concern for you at work, while you perceive that your co-workers aren't as serious about this issue. Let's break this down - the situation involves your work environment and the behavior of your co-workers. The thoughts linked to it are your frustration and fear about the potential harm from unsafe practices. It's important to note that your thoughts are based on your interpretations of the situation.","Yes, that's correct. I am concerned about safety and I interpret my co-workers' behavior as dismissive towards this issue. My thoughts about them not taking the safety seriously make me feel frustrated and scared. I wish they'd understand the importance of safety precautions.","That's a valid concern and it's great that you've identified your thoughts about the situation. Now, let's try to think about alternative interpretations. Is it possible that what you see as disregard for safety, could be due to something else? Could it be a lack of proper training or the absence of a strict enough management emphasizing on safety? Or perhaps, they might be aware of the risks but are not showing it in the way you expect? Let's try to think about other possible scenarios.","You're right, I might be interpreting their actions incorrectly. Maybe they haven't had sufficient training to understand the risks involved, or possibly the management has not been emphasizing the importance of safety enough. It could also be that they are aware of the risks but aren't expressing their concern in the way I expect. I hadn't thought of these perspectives before. It might be valuable to have a discussion about safety in our next team meeting.","I'm glad to see you considering other possible interpretations. These new perspectives show great empathy and understanding on your part. Organizing a safety discussion during your next team meeting is an excellent proactive move, and it might really help address the issue in a constructive way. Remember, it's always beneficial to communicate and clarifying assumptions can not only ease your worry but also potentially improve the overall safety practices at your workplace. Keep up the positive thinking!",
925,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,"Someone was staring at me on this bus, it must be because I am fat and ugly.","I was on the bus earlier today, and I couldn't help but notice someone staring at me. It made me feel really self-conscious, and I started to think that the only reason they were staring was because I'm fat and ugly. It's really been bothering me and making me feel really down about myself.","It sounds like the situation is that you were on a bus and noticed someone looking at you, which made you uncomfortable. However, the thought you attached to that moment is that they must have been staring because of your appearance. It's important to acknowledge these two elements as distinctly separate.","The first element is the fact of the situation, which is someone was looking at you. The second element is your interpretation, which is the belief that they were negatively evaluating you because of your appearance. These two elements are not necessarily connected, and it might be helpful for us to consider alternative explanations for the first element. Could the person have been staring at something behind you, daydreaming, or just happened to look in your direction? Let's explore different ideas.","That's a good understanding. Now, let's consider a few possibilities. Maybe they were admiring your style, or could have been lost in their thoughts and not actively observing you. It's also plausible they were looking in your direction without any particular thoughts about you. What do you think about these possibilities and do you have any other interpretations that might be less negative?","You're right, it's possible they were not even looking at me but at something behind me. Or maybe they were staring blankly and got lost in their own thoughts. Even if they were looking at me, they might not have necessarily been thinking negatively about me. They could even have been admiring my outfit or something. I suppose I tend to jump to negative conclusions too quickly.","That's a significant realization and I'm really proud of you for considering other possible interpretations. It's completely natural to have immediate, sometimes negative, reactions to situations, but as you have already begun to do, contemplating other possibilities can shift your perspective to a more positive one. Remember that your worth is not determined by the thoughts or actions of others. Over time, with practice, you'll get better at separating situations from your negative thoughts about them. Keep the good work!",
926,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I tried to teach my son how to play a piece on the piano. He did poorly. He will never learn how to play.,I tried to teach my son how to play a piece on the piano. He did poorly. He will never learn how to play.,It seems like you're facing two separate things here. One is the situation - you teaching your son how to play a piece on the piano. And the other is the interpretation of that event - that your son will never learn how to play. Would you agree with that separation?,"Yes, I suppose I can see the separation between the two. I taught him how to play, and that went poorly, and I've taken that as a sign that he'll never be able to learn.","Let's consider some alternative interpretations of the same situation. For instance, could it be possible that your son may need more time to learn? Or maybe, a different teaching method might work better for him? It's also could be possible that he was just having an off day. What do you think about these possibilities?","You're right. I may have jumped to conclusions too quickly. It's true that he might need more time to learn or maybe a different teaching method could be more effective. And yes, everybody could have an off day. It may not be fair of me to decide he's incapable just from this one instance. Thanks for offering those perspectives.","I applaud your openness to these new ways of looking at the situation. You're right, it really isn't fair to judge anyone's ability, let alone your son's, based on one instance. Everybody has their own pace when it comes to learning and it's important to give him the space and time he needs. I think you being patient and exploring different teaching methods could be a real game changer here. Keep going, you're doing a great job.",
927,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,The traffic is always making me late for work. My boss must think I am a loser for coming in late all the time.,"I feel so frustrated and stressed out because the traffic is always causing me to be late for work. It's like no matter how early I leave, there's always some kind of delay that throws my whole schedule off. I can't help but think that my boss must think I'm unreliable or incompetent for constantly showing up late. It's really starting to affect my confidence and self-esteem.","I understand that you're feeling stressed and frustrated about the traffic affecting your punctuality at work. Let's separate the situation and your thoughts about it. The traffic is something out of your control, but your thoughts and feelings about how your boss might perceive you due to it is causing you distress. Nothing is confirmed about your boss's thoughts, so it's just an assumption at this point.",That's true. I suppose I've been assuming the worst because I'm stressed. I don't actually know for sure what my boss thinks. It's the uncertainty that gets to me and the feeling of not having any control over the situation. I've been letting these assumptions control my self-esteem and confidence.,"I appreciate your realization. It's normal to feel stressed when dealing with situations beyond our control. Let's think about other possible scenarios here. What if, for instance, your boss understands the unpredictable nature of the traffic and doesn't judge your reliability based on it? Or perhaps there are other strategies you could employ to handle the delays, such as leaving even earlier or discussing with your boss about shifting your start time to avoid peak traffic?","You're right. I've been hurrying and stressing myself out to conform to this schedule that might actually have some flexibility. My boss might be more understanding than I'm giving them credit for, and if I explain the situation, they might even be open to adjusting my start time or allowing me more flexibility. As for leaving earlier, that's something I could definitely try to do and see how it affects the traffic. I guess I've been so focused on the negatives, I haven't really considered the possible solutions or positive aspects. Thank you for opening my eyes to that.","I'm really pleased to see you considering these alternative scenarios and solutions. Recognizing that your boss might be understanding and that you do have options to deal with the traffic, shows that you're not powerless in this situation. It can be easy to focus on the negatives when stressed, but you've done an amazing job at reframing your thoughts here. I encourage you to implement these strategies, communicate with your boss about the issues, and observe any changes in your stress levels. Remember, it's okay to seek flexibility when circumstances are out of your control.",
928,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,My best friend moved away which is a shame as it likely means that I'm an unworthy friend and will never make another one.,I've been feeling really down lately because my best friend moved away. It just makes me feel like I'm not a good friend and that I won't be able to make another close connection like that again.,I understand you're feeling down because your best friend moved away. That's a tough situation. But it's important to recognize that your friend's decision to move isn't a reflection of your worth as a friend. It's a situation that you had no control over. What makes you think that you won't be able to make another close friendship again?,"I guess it's just the fear of not being able to replicate the bond we had. We understood each other so well. It took years to build that kind of trust and I'm afraid I might not have that kind of time or energy anymore to invest in someone new. Also, the fear of rejection or the friendship not working out is holding me back.","I understand that fear. Building a strong friendship like the one you had does take time and energy. I acknowledge that fear of rejection and it can be quite challenging. But let's consider some other possibilities. What if this change in your life opens up a new opportunity for you to meet different people? Or maybe this can even be a chance for you to explore more about yourself. Why don't we also think about your past? You've built a close bond once, is it not possible that you could do it again? Look at your strengths, maybe you have qualities within you that attract people and cultivate deep friendships. Let's balance out the fear with these possibilities. What are your thoughts on these?","Well, I haven't thought about it like that before. I suppose moving could allow me to meet new people and indeed enhance my own personal growth. And you're right, I formed a close friendship once before, it's possible I could do it again. Reflecting on it, I do have qualities that have helped me form deep connections in the past. Those haven't gone away just because my friend moved. It's still scary, but maybe it's not as impossible as I originally thought. Thank you.","That's a truly insightful way of looking at the situation, and it shows your resilience and capacity for self-reflection. Remember, it's completely normal to feel scared in the face of change and uncertainty. But, as you rightly pointed out, the qualities that helped you foster deep connections in the past are still with you. They could absolutely help you build new ones in the future, too. Take this time to embrace the changes, allow yourself to grow, and remember it's absolutely okay to take it at your own pace.",
929,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,My dog is struggling in his puppy training classes. He's never going to be housetrained.,I'm feeling really frustrated and discouraged because my dog is struggling so much in his puppy training classes. I'm starting to doubt if he will ever be housetrained.,"I understand how you might feel discouraged about this situation. Let's try to pull apart the issue at hand from your emotional reaction. Your dog is having difficulty with his training classes, and you're feeling frustrated and doubting his progress. These experiences and feelings are not permanently connected though. How might this situation be different without these intense feelings?","Well, I suppose if I wasn't feeling so frustrated and doubtful, I might be more patient with my dog's progress. I could see the improvements he's made so far more clearly instead of focusing on what he's still struggling with. It could also make the training process more enjoyable for both of us.","That's a great start. Emotions can often cloud our judgement. Now, let's think of other possibilities. What if your dog's struggle has nothing to do with your abilities or his learning speed? Can you think of any other aspects that could be contributing to the training process? How might the situation change if we approach it from a different angle or perspective?","Maybe his struggles have something to do with how the classes are conducted or if he's comfortable around the other puppies. Or perhaps he's not responding well to the training methods being used. If these were the case, maybe changing the environment or trying different training methods could help improve his progress. If I approached the situation from this perspective, it wouldn't feel like a personal failure but more of a problem-solving task. It could change how I'm viewing the whole situation.","I'm really glad to see you're opening up to different possibilities here. That's a significant progress. It's definitely possible that it's the class environment or the training methods, not you or your dog, that's causing this struggle. Remember, it's not a reflection of your personal ability but a common scenario many pet owners face while training their puppies. Keep trying different strategies, be patient and willing to adjust to find what works best for your dog. You're doing a great job and your effort will eventually pay off, so don't lose heart.",

The culture, the food, the people, it's all amazing. But there's just one thing that always leaves me feeling disappointed and even a little depressed - there's no place for me to ski. Skiing is one of my favorite activities, and not being able to enjoy it during my trips to Mexico has become a source of sadness for me.","I understand your love for skiing and how that might cast a shadow on your visits to Mexico. But let's separate the situation for a minute: you love going to Mexico and all that it offers, and you also love skiing which is something you can't do there. Is it possible that you're allowing the latter to impact your overall enjoyment of the former?","That's an interesting way to look at it... I never thought about it that way. I suppose I have been letting the lack of skiing opportunities overshadow all the other wonderful things about Mexico. But it's just hard for me, as it's really something I look forward to doing in my leisure time.","I can understand how important skiing is to you. But let's try to think a bit differently. Considering your trips to Mexico offer a lot of other amazing experiences, perhaps there are other activities you could explore while you're there, maybe even something adventurous like skiing? Could there be alternative activities that might provide a similar thrill or connect you to nature in the same way skiing does?","You’re right, I haven’t really taken the time to think about alternative activities. I guess I’ve been so focused on the lack of skiing that I failed to consider the vast number of other adventurous activities one can do in Mexico. Activities that could perhaps offer a similar thrill that skiing does for me. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to start exploring what those could be. Thank you for helping me see this from a new perspective.","That's a great shift in perspective! I'm glad you're open to exploring new activities on your trips to Mexico. Just like skiing, there are many experiences out there that could provide the thrill and connection with nature you love. Remember, adventures come in many different forms and sometimes the joys we discover when we try new things can pleasantly surprise us. It's all part of taking this journey. Many of these new experiences could add even more depth to your appreciation of Mexico's culture and people. You may just discover new favorites to look forward to. I encourage you to keep an open mind and heart, and embrace new experiences with the same enthusiasm you have for skiing.",

I'm convinced that all my efforts have been wasted, and I feel terrible about it.",I understand you're feeling down about the situation. Let's try to separate the facts from your thoughts. You've built a PC for your friend. That's the situation. But you're also assuming that he dislikes it which is causing you distress. It's important to remember that your friend's reaction is a separate factor.,"You're right, I must separate the situation from my feelings. The only thing I know for sure is that I have built a PC for my friend. I don't have any actual proof that he hates it or that my efforts have been wasted. The rest are just assumptions that I have made and I understand that I should not let these assumptions affect me negatively.","That's a great realization. Now, let's look at some other possible scenarios regarding your friend and the PC. Could it be possible that your friend may have liked the PC or appreciated your efforts but didn't express it that openly? Maybe he's unfamiliar with PCs and doesn't know how to show his gratitude? Perhaps he's having a personal issue that's affecting his reactions. Try considering other views to this situation.","You're correct, there are plenty of other possibilities that I haven't considered. Perhaps my friend does appreciate the PC but has difficulty expressing his gratitude. Or maybe he's currently going through a tough time, which might have affected his reaction. I haven't thought of these scenarios, and I realize now that my initial assumption could very well be wrong.","That's some valuable reflection you've done there, and it's really a good progress. Remember, everyone perceives and reacts to situations differently. It's quite possible your friend appreciates your efforts more than you initially thought. You should feel proud of the work you've done, regardless of his reaction. If you're still unsure about his thoughts on the PC, perhaps you could have an open conversation with him. It's important not to let assumptions and negative thoughts minimize your achievements or dictate your self-esteem. Keep these other possibilities in mind moving forward.",

Mine just look so old and frail in comparison. It's been bothering me and making me question whether I'm doing something wrong with my gardening.","It sounds like you're comparing the state of your sunflowers to your neighbor's, and this is making you feel down. Let's try to separate the situation from your thoughts. The situation might be that your sunflowers seem different from your neighbors', but the thought that 'you're doing something wrong with gardening' is your interpretation of this situation. Is that right?","Yes, that's right. I keep thinking that I'm not good enough at gardening because my sunflowers don't look as glowing and healthy as those in the garden next door. It's a bit disheartening.","I can understand why you might feel that way. But let's try and think of some other possibilities. Could there be other reasons why your sunflowers look different? For instance, could it be that the sunflowers are of a different variety, or that they receive different amounts of sunlight or water? Or, could your feelings be influenced by other factors, perhaps unrelated to gardening?","You're right, my sunflowers might just be a different type than my neighbor's, or perhaps they get more shade because of the tall tree next door. Also, now that I think about it, I've been feeling insecure about my abilities in general lately, not just in gardening. It's possible that I might be projecting those feelings onto how I view my sunflowers.","That's some great insight. It's really possible that the differences you see in your sunflowers compared to your neighbor's may be due to variations in variety or environmental factors - things that aren't really within your control. And remember, every gardener has their own unique journey, it's all about learning and growing. It’s also very brave of you to acknowledge your broader insecurities. Perhaps these feelings are affecting how you see your abilities. It might be helpful to focus on your accomplishments, in gardening or otherwise, and remember that everyone has areas where they can improve. Keep nurturing your garden, and yourself, just like you would your sunflowers!",
933,Discounting the positive,"My boss just praised the work I did for public relations, but now that'll just put more pressure on me to always succeed.","I feel really conflicted about my boss praising the work I did for public relations. On one hand, it's great to receive recognition and validation for my efforts. It makes me feel proud and accomplished. However, on the other hand, I can't help but feel a sense of pressure now. I worry that this praise will set higher expectations for me in the future, and I'll be constantly under pressure to perform at an exceptional level. It's like the fear of failure has intensified now.","You're feeling proud because your boss praised your work, but at the same time, you're feeling a lot of pressure due to potential higher expectations in the future. It seems like your situation is the recognition of your work and your thought is a fear of not repeating this level of success. Does that resonate with you?","Yes, that resonates with me completely. The recognition brings pride, but at the same time, it's also generating a lot of fear and pressure within me. I just don't want to disappoint my boss or fail to meet their expectations in the future.","I understand where you’re coming from. Now, let's try thinking about this situation from a different angle. What could be other possibilities arising from your boss praising your work? How could you perceive this situation if you believe your boss has faith in your abilities and trusts you to do well in the future? Or consider if you see this praise as recognition of your ability to learn and grow. How would that change your outlook?
","That's an interesting way to look at it. If I understand correctly, you're suggesting that I view my boss's praises not as expectations, but as affirmations of their faith and trust in my abilities, and the fact that they believe I can handle more. Also, instead of fear of future expectations, I could see it as an opportunity to further learn, grow and strengthen my skills. I suppose, with this perspective, I'd feel less pressure and more excitement and motivation towards my future projects. It might even boost my self-confidence. It sounds really affirming and encouraging when I think about it this way.","That's a wonderful reframing of your situation! By viewing your boss's praise as an affirmation of your abilities and potential for growth, you'll naturally feel more confident and less stressed about future expectations. Remember, each new project is an opportunity to learn and grow, and they believe in you. It's great that you're open to this positive perspective. It's all about making the most of our experiences and learning from them, rather than being consumed by fear or pressure. Keep up the good work and believe in your abilities!",
934,Mental filtering,"I need to quit my job. I love that I get out of work in time to pick up my kids at school, but I don't have an assigned parking space and I sometimes have to walk 2 or 3 minutes to get into the office.","I've been thinking lately that I need to quit my job. Even though I enjoy being able to pick up my kids from school on time, one of the things that bothers me is not having an assigned parking space. It may sound silly, but having to walk 2 or 3 minutes to get into the office can be quite frustrating for me.",I understand that the parking situation is causing frustration. Let's try to separate the situation from the feelings it's causing. The situation is that you have to walk 2 or 3 minutes from your parking spot to your office. The thought that this is sparking is that you're considering quitting your job. Is that correct?,"Yes, you've got it right. It's true that the lack of a specific parking lot has been bothering me to the point that I'm considering quitting the job, even though there are parts of it that I really like.","I see, it sounds like there's a conflict between your irritation with the parking situation and your enjoyment of other job aspects. Can you think of any other ways to approach this issue, perhaps alterations you could make to your commute or ways to make the walk more enjoyable? Alternatively, could there be potential solutions within your work environment or through discussions with management?","Yes, I guess I can try to get to work a little bit earlier. That might give me a chance to get a closer parking spot. Or I could try to make the walk more pleasant by listening to music or podcasts. As for discussing this with management, I'm worried they might not take my concern seriously, but maybe it's worth a shot. I didn't consider these options before, I was just focused on my frustration.","That's a great start at looking at the situation from a new perspective! Coming to work earlier might indeed help you get a closer spot. Also, turning the walk into a pleasant ritual, like listening to a favorite podcast or some music, could turn this inconvenience into something you actually look forward to. As for your concern about management, remember that they are there to ensure a positive work environment and your feedback can be valuable to them. I encourage you to carry these ideas forward and see how you can turn this situation around. It's all about finding the positive potential in our challenges.",
935,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,My partner hate me because I watch mma.,I've been feeling really down lately because I have this thought that my partner hates me because I watch mixed martial arts (MMA).,"I understand you're feeling quite negative currently. However, it's important to clarify if your thought is directly reliant on concrete evidence or if it's an assumption based on your own worries.","Honestly, I am not sure if it's based on concrete evidence or if it's just my own fears and worries at play here. I guess they've shown disinterest whenever I've tried discussing MMA with them and this has led me to believe that they might hate me for it.","It seems like you're interpreting your partner's disinterest in MMA as dislike towards you. However, there could be other possibilities. Could it be that your partner is simply not interested in MMA, but this doesn't reflect on their feelings towards you as a person? Maybe they have different interests? What else could it possibly indicate?","That's a fair point. I suppose they might simply not have the same interest in MMA as I do. It's just that I'm quite passionate about it and seeing their lack of enthusiasm about something I like so much made me feel unwanted. But now that you've mentioned it, it could just as easily indicate a difference in interests and nothing more.","It's wonderful to see you considering different perspectives. Appreciating each other's differences can often strengthen relationships. The beauty of individuality lies in our unique interests and passions, and your partner’s lack of interest in MMA doesn’t necessarily relate to their feelings towards you. Your feeling of being unwanted likely stems more from your interpretation of their reactions than from their actual feelings. Remember to communicate openly about your feelings, this might bring you closer and help you understand each other better.",
936,Catastrophizing,My coworker didn't go to work today. Maybe she got sick and will die.,I've been feeling really worried about my coworker today. She didn't show up for work and I can't help but wonder if something serious might have happened to her.,"It sounds like you're quite concerned for your coworker, it's natural to care about their wellness. Let's try to differentiate the situation from your thoughts. The factual situation is that your coworker didn't come to work today. What thoughts are concerning you related to this situation?","Well, when I noticed she wasn't there, my mind started racing with bad thoughts. I immediately started thinking maybe she got seriously sick and might even pass away. I know it's a big leap, but I can't help it.","It's completely understandable to worry, especially when someone's absence is unexpected. However, there could be numerous reasons for your coworker's absence. Could you think of some other, perhaps less serious, possibilities?","Yes, I suppose she could simply be on a day off, or maybe she has some personal things she needs to handle. Perhaps she's just feeling a little under the weather and needed a rest day. Maybe even she had to take care of her children or had some other family responsibilities. I guess it doesn't necessarily mean she's critically ill or something.","That's a great shift in perspective! It's indeed possible that her absence could be due to a variety of non-threatening reasons such as taking a personal day, handling some family responsibilities, or even simply needing a rest day. You're showing great empathy towards your coworker. It's important to remember uncertainty is not necessarily negativity. Let's focus on these possible scenarios and put the catastrophic thoughts on hold. You've done well in thinking through possible alternatives, which is a very constructive approach.",
937,Mental filtering,"Even though my girlfriend said yes to my proposal, she didn't seem as excited about the ring as I thought she would. I bet our marriage is gonna be a failure.","I've been feeling a little worried about my upcoming marriage. Even though my girlfriend said yes to my proposal, I couldn't help but notice that she didn't seem as excited about the ring as I expected her to be. It's making me question if our marriage is going to be successful or if there's something wrong.","It sounds like you're feeling uncertain about your upcoming marriage because of your girlfriend's reaction to the ring. Remember, it's important to distinguish between the external situation, which is the proposal, and your interpretation of it, which is her alleged lack of excitement. What else could her reaction possibly mean, other than your current interpretation?","Well, maybe she was just surprised or she had different expectations about how the proposal would go. Or she might have been under some kind of stress or pressure that day. I do realize that there could be numerous reasons for her reaction that are unrelated to our relationship. It's also possible that I'm reading too much into her reactions because of my own insecurities or fears about marriage.","You've come up with some insightful alternatives. Her response could have been influenced by a variety of factors, and it's possible that it wasn't a reflection of doubts about your relationship. It's also important that we consider that our own insecurities can sometimes skew our interpretations. Considering all this, how would that alter your understanding of her reaction and of your impending marriage?","I suppose if I consider these different possibilities, it could mean that her reaction was not an indicator of our impending marriage being a failure. It's possible that I'm letting my own fear or insecurity about marriage influence how I interpret her actions. Maybe there's no problem at all with our relationship, and I've been worrying over nothing. I guess I should try to communicate with her about my worries to clear things up.","I appreciate your openness to different possibilities and your willingness to introspect. You're absolutely correct. Communication is key in any relationship. It's perfectly fine to have insecurities and fears, but sharing them can help alleviate unnecessary stress. Remember, your feeling's validity shouldn't be measured just by a single reaction but by the overall health and happiness of your relationship. Trust in your relationship and in your decision to marry. You've got this!",
938,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,In my free time I enjoy watching the clouds. I'll be hit my lightning eventually.,"In my free time, I enjoy watching the clouds and finding comfort in their changing patterns and movements. But sometimes, I can't shake off the feeling that I'll be struck by lightning eventually. It's like a constant underlying fear that clouds my enjoyment and makes me worried about something that may never happen. I want to find a way to overcome this fear and fully embrace the peace and tranquility that cloud-watching brings me.","I see. Let's try to look at the situation and your thoughts separately. The situation is you enjoying your time watching the clouds. Your thought, however, is the fear of being struck by lightning. These two are not necessarily connected.","You're right. When I pick it apart like that, I see that I enjoy cloud-watching because it's peaceful and calming. But then, I've got this bolt-on fear of being struck by lightning which is an irrational fear. They're totally separate things. I suppose I've let this anxiety creep into my enjoyment of watching the clouds.","That's a great step forward, analyzing your emotions like this. Now, let's think about other possibilities while you are cloud watching. For example, what are some positive scenarios that could happen instead of being struck by lightning? What are the probabilities of these events happening, statistically speaking, compared to being hit by a bolt?","You're absolutely right. When I think about it that way, I realize there are many other things that could occur. I could discover new shapes and forms in the clouds that trigger my imagination, I could simply enjoy the serenity and calmness, or I could notice other beautiful aspects of nature all around me. Statistically speaking, I'm probably more likely to see a rainbow than get struck by lightning. This thought makes me feel a lot better and less anxious.","I'm really proud of your effort in brainstorming these alternatives. You've made an important stride in reframing your thoughts. As you've rightly pointed out, the chances of spotting a rainbow, engaging your imagination, and appreciating nature's beauty are far greater than a lightning strike. Remember, it's this tranquil experience and positivity we should focus on. So, the next time you go cloud-watching, embrace the serenity and imagine the wonderful possibilities. You are in control of your thoughts and emotions. Keep practicing this positive thinking and soon it will become second nature to you. Let's conquer this fear together.",
939,Discounting the positive,"I've worked as a nurse for 20 years now, but I just answer phone calls and people say I'm not a real nurse.","I've been feeling really insecure lately about my profession as a nurse. I mean, I've dedicated 20 years of my life to this career and have learned so much along the way. But recently, I've been receiving comments from people saying that I'm not a real nurse because all I do is answer phone calls. It's been really affecting my self-esteem and I find myself questioning my own worth as a healthcare professional.","I hear how those comments have affected your self-esteem, but remember those are just opinions of other people. Let's separate these comments from your actual thoughts. You said, ""I'm not a real nurse because all I do is answer phone calls"". Is this your thought or is it directly from the comments you've received?","It's directly from the comments that I received. I guess I started believing it myself, even if deep down I know that it's not entirely true. I mean, I worked hard to become a nurse and I do more than just answer phone calls, but those words have deeply affected me.","I understand that comments can be very affecting. But since we've established those comments don't accurately reflect your work let's think of other possibilities. What are some other perspectives on your role as a nurse that you could consider, especially considering your years of experience and the hard work you've put into your profession?","Well, I suppose another perspective could be that my job as a nurse is not defined by narrow tasks such as answering phone calls. Maybe the people who made the comments don't fully understand what my job entails. In reality, these phone calls often involve complex care coordination, educating patients and their families about disease processes, medication management, and carrying out physician orders. These are highly skilled tasks that require nursing knowledge, decision-making, and critical thinking. Moreover, I have dedicated twenty years to this profession, constantly learning and improving, which is equally important - it's not just the tasks that I do but also the dedication, devotion, and care that I put into my work.","That's a much more comprehensive and accurate perspective of your profession. You're absolutely right - being a nurse involves a wide range of tasks that require deep knowledge, decision-making, and excellent critical thinking skills. Your dedication and devotion to your profession for twenty years is evidence of your commitment and expertise. Remember, your value as a nurse isn't decided by the opinions of a few people but by the complexity of your work and the impact you have on your patients daily. Keep embracing this perspective, and let it guide you through any doubt or insecurity.",
940,Overgeneralization,"I'm a librarian, no one will ever find me attractive.",I have this thought that being a librarian makes it difficult for people to find me attractive.,It sounds like your thought is tied to your occupation as a librarian. Is it correct to say that your job and people finding you attractive have become linked in your mind?,"Yes, that's correct. I often feel that my job as a librarian isn't very glamorous or exciting, which makes me think people don't find me attractive.","It's interesting how we link our own self-perceptions to our occupations. However, attractiveness can be based on a wide range of factors, not just our jobs. Can you think of some situations or ways that people might find you attractive due to your work as a librarian?","Well, I have heard from a few people that they find my knowledge and passion for books attractive. Also, I guess as a librarian I come across as organized and responsible, which I believe can be appealing traits to others. I've also heard on a couple occasions that people find the quiet and controlled environment of a library calming and attractive. I suppose I've just been focusing on the negatives and overlooking these things.","I'm really glad you were able to recognize those positive aspects of being a librarian. People genuinely do admire others who are knowledgeable, passionate, organized and responsible. The calming environment of a library is another appeal that not many other professions offer. Your profession brings with it unique attributes that are indeed attractive to others. Each occupation has its own charm, including yours as a librarian. It's important to remember that attractiveness stems from a multitude of factors and you possess many of them. Keep focusing on these positives. You might find that this new perspective enhances the way you see yourself and how others perceive you too.",
941,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,The raptors haven't won in so long. They are goin to sell the team to another city and I will never see them again.,"I've been feeling really worried and sad lately because I heard rumors that the Raptors might be sold to another city. I've been a fan for so long, and the thought of not being able to see them play anymore is really upsetting to me.","I see you're feeling very worried and upset about the possible sale of the Raptors. That's a situation you've heard about which you can't control directly. Now, let's look at your thoughts regarding this situation. You're feeling upset primarily because you fear that you won't be able to see them play anymore if they are sold. Correct me if wrong.","Yes, that's exactly right. The fear of not being able to see my favorite team play anymore is really distressing for me. I've been following them deeply for so long, and it's sort of like I'm losing a part of myself if they are sold to another city.","I understand you feel a deep connection with the team and it might feel like losing a part of yourself. Let's consider some other possibilities under the same situation. For example, if the team is sold, it's not necessarily a complete loss of viewing opportunities, is it? There could be other ways you might still connect with the team or have similar experiences. Have you thought about what else could possibly happen?","I haven't really thought about that… I guess if they were to be sold, I could still watch their games on TV or online, or even travel to see a few games. It wouldn't be the same as having them in my home city, but I guess it's one way to keep up with the team. It's a different perspective I hadn't considered. But then again, I still dread the emotional impact of them leaving the city.","I'm glad you're starting to consider other possibilities. Watching games on TV or online, or even travelling to see a few games can still keep you connected to the Raptors. It's definitely valid to grieve over something you cared about and feel a deep connection with. But remember, losing one way to connect with something you love can sometimes open an unexpected door to a unique and equally fulfilling experience. Let's focus on these possible positive outcomes from now on to manage the negative emotions better.",
942,Personalization,I am a widow because I was a bad husband.,"I believe that I am a widow because I was a bad husband. I constantly think about the mistakes I made in my marriage and how it contributed to my wife's passing. I feel guilty and responsible for her death, and it's overwhelming me with regret and self-blame.","I can see you're really hurting from your wife's passing and it sounds like you're blaming yourself for it. It's important to remember that being a widower is a situation that happened to you, it doesn't define who you are. The thought you are wrestling with is self-blame and guilt. These are feelings, not facts. Could we consider other possibilities about the situation?","Yes, I would be open to considering other possibilities about the situation. I understand that feelings aren't factual and I'd like to explore other views on this painful situation.","That's a healthy approach and I'm glad to hear it. You're a widower now, that's true. But let's brainstorm other possibilities about why this happened. Can you think of any reasons that are unrelated to the way you behaved in your marriage? It might include illness, accidents, or any external factors. Remember, the aim is not to find the 'truth', but to open up to different ways of interpreting the situation.","You're right, my wife did have a chronic illness. It affected her health significantly towards the end. Despite her best efforts and the treatments we pursued, her health kept deteriorating. I've, often in my mourning, downplayed the role of her illness in her passing. Maybe the self-blame is just an easier way to make sense of it all than to accept the randomness and unfairness of her illness. She was also involved in a car accident a year before her death, which affected her overall well-being. But in my mind, I've downplayed these contributing factors and kept clinging to my mistakes and wrongs. These external circumstances could indeed have played a major role in her death.","Your willingness to reflect and open up to other perspectives of the situation is commendable. It's clear that you loved your wife deeply. Chronic illness and accidents, like she experienced, are beyond anyone's control. Rather than burdening yourself with guilt, it may be more healing to remember the good times shared, the love given and received, and the strength shown in dealing with adversities together. Mourning a loss is never easy, but it's important to do so with kindness towards yourself. Remember, it's not about finding a reason or cause to blame, but about finding your path to healing.",
943,Mental filtering,My drawing that I was working is ruined.  Sure it came out great and all of the colors are rich and vivid but I forgot to put the date on it.,"I'm feeling really frustrated and disappointed right now. I had been working on a drawing that I was really proud of, and it turned out really well. The colors are vibrant and everything, but I just realized I forgot to put the date on it. It feels like all that effort might go to waste now.","It sounds like you're dealing with a really tough situation. Let's break it down though. The situation is that you have created a beautiful piece of art that you're proud of, but forgot to put the date on it. Your thought related to this situation is that forgetting the date has invalidated all your hard work. It's important to understand these two are separate - the situation and your assumptions about it.",You're right. I think I was conflating the two aspects. I can see now that the situation itself is that I completed a drawing that I'm proud of. My assumption about forgetting to put the date is what's bringing me down. It's not a fact that my work is ruined simply because I didn't include the date.,"That's great! You've separated the situation from your initial thought about it. Now let's consider other possibilities related to your situation. Could it be possible that the date isn't as important as the effort you put into and the result of your work—that the value of your art isn't diminished because you forgot to date it? Or perhaps, forgetting to put the date might even give it a timeless quality, don't you think? What other possibilities could you imagine?","You're right, I never considered those possibilities before. I suppose not having a date could give the drawing a sense of timelessness. And, it's true that the effort I put into creating this artwork and the outcome should carry more weight than a missing date. Maybe it's even somehow liberating to not have a specific date attached to it, it could allow the piece to exist outside of a specific time frame... This is really helping me view the situation from a different perspective.","I'm really glad to see you exploring other perspectives on this situation. It's truly insightful of you to realize that the lack of a date could actually free your art from time constraints, making it timeless and universally appealing. Remember, the value of your artwork lies not in the attached date, but in the effort, creativity, and passion you've put into it. These are the factors that truly define your work. This reframed thought seems to be particularly empowering for you, and that's a great takeaway from this discussion.

944,Discounting the positive,"My parents are proud of me taking care of them, but anyone with parents will do so.","I sometimes feel like my parents are overly proud of me for taking care of them, but I also think that anyone with parents would do the same. It doesn't feel like something extraordinary that should warrant such excessive praise.",It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about the praise you receive from your parents for assisting them. Can you help me understand these feelings a bit better? Can we separate the act of caring for your parents from the emotions you have about their praise?,"Sure, when I think of taking care of my parents, it doesn't seem like a big deal for me. I mean, they are my parents and I feel obligated, like it's my duty to look after them, especially now when they are getting older. 

But when they praise me for doing so, I feel awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe because I perceive taking care of parents as something normal, something that every child ought to do. I don't see it as something to be proud of or something that deserves praise. It somehow feels like they are making a big deal out of something I consider ordinary. I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking.","It's clear that you see caring for your parents as a given, which in itself is a very admirable perspective. However, consider this: might it be possible that your parents' praise isn't just an appreciation for the act of caregiving itself, but for the person you are – loving, dutiful, and responsible? What if, from their point of view, they're expressing their gratitude for having raised such an empathetic and caring individual? What other interpretations could there be for their praises?","I've never really thought of it that way before. Perhaps they are praising me not just for the acts of caregiving but also for the compassion and responsibility I've shown. Maybe they are just grateful, and their praises are a way of expressing their love and gratitude. I guess I could also see it as them feeling lucky or blessed to have a child who is there for them in their old age, as not all do. Perhaps I've been too focused on the action itself rather than the sentiment behind their words.","Absolutely, you've hit the nail on the head. It's wonderful to see you opening up to other interpretations of your parents' praise. Remember, caregiving is seen by many as an extraordinary deed and doesn't go unnoticed, no matter how normal it seems to you. It sounds like your compassion and dedication speak volumes about your character. Their praise is likely their way of acknowledging this and expressing gratitude for the loving individual you are. Keep this reframed perspective in mind the next time they express their appreciation. You're truly doing a great job!",
945,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,"I usually go to bed late,  I'll never succeed in my life",I usually go to bed late and I feel like I'll never succeed in my life. It's been a constant struggle to establish a proper sleep routine and I worry that this lack of discipline will hold me back from achieving my goals.,I understand you're feeling apprehensive about your future due to your current sleep habits. Let's begin by separating the situation from the thought. The situation is your late bedtime and feeling of not having a disciplined sleep routine. The thought is your fear that this may hinder you from achieving your goals. Can we examine this separately?,"Yes, let's examine this separately. These thoughts of not being successful because of my irregular sleep schedule are becoming a cause of stress for me.","That's a significant step in understanding the distinction. Now, let's consider some alternative perspectives. Do you think it's possible that achieving success is not entirely dependent on a sleep routine? In other words, could there be individuals who have irregular sleep schedules yet have managed to be successful? Or could your unique schedule be used to benefit you in some way? Gaining success is multifaceted and comprises of more than just a sleep routine. Let's try to think of some other ways you may be able to achieve your goals. What are some strategies you think might be helpful?","I suppose I could still achieve success even with my irregular sleep pattern, especially if I'm productive during my awake hours. There might actually people out there who are successful despite having unusual schedules. As for strategies, maybe I could try to work out a schedule that complements my current sleep routine, as long as I am completing all tasks required on a daily basis. I also think that setting specific goals, minding my physical health, and seeking support from others might be beneficial.","That's some great insight! Yes, there's no set mold for success and it can definitely be achieved despite an irregular sleep routine. As you've mentioned, utilizing awake hours effectively, setting specific goals, focusing on physical health, and seeking support are all crucial strategies. Remember, our paths to success are unique to us and it's essential to adapt and rearrange our schedule in a way that suits our individual lifestyle best. Let's journey together in your self-exploration and discovery of the most efficient way for you to meet your goals. Success is not a destination, but an ongoing process of growth and personal development. Keep going!",
946,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,A stranger brushed me off when I tried to talk to them. They probably hate me.,"I had an encounter today where I tried to talk to a stranger, but they completely brushed me off. It made me think that they probably hate me.","I see, you had an encounter with a stranger today and they brushed you off. But could it be possible that the conclusion you've drawn from their behavior - that they hate you - may not be the full picture of the situation?","Yes, I suppose it could be possible. I may have jumped to conclusions. Maybe there's something else I'm not considering. I mean, they're a stranger so they don't know me to hate me. But I can't help but feel somewhat undesirable or unpleasant.","It's great that you're already seeing there could be other factors at play. Let's explore some other possibilities. Perhaps the stranger had a bad day, was preoccupied with their own thoughts or has personal issues that make them react in that way. Their reaction could have very little to do with you personally. Can you think of any other scenarios that could explain their actions?","Yes, I guess that makes sense. They could have been having a really bad day or dealing with some personal problems that has nothing to do with me. They also might be in a hurry or maybe they're just not the kind who easily engages with unfamiliar people. But it's just hard not to take it personally.","That's a great perspective you've offered. You're right that their behavior could have been due to a variety of factors. Remember, it’s impossible for us to know exactly what others are going through at any given moment, and much of their behavior is genuinely about them, not about us. It’s tough not to take things personally, especially when you’re reaching out to connect, but don’t let this deter you. Everyone, at times, faces rejection and it's a perfectly normal part of life. Keep working on seeing the situation from different angles as you did now, and it could really help in preventing unnecessary negative feelings about yourself.",
947,Should statements,"I should never get sent to prison, given my parents work in law.",I've been thinking a lot about my parents' career in law and how it might affect my own life. It's been on my mind that I should never end up in prison because of their professions.,"It sounds like your thoughts are heavily influenced by your parents' careers. Let's try to separate your own life and choices from your parents' profession. Your future, including any legal situations, is determined by your actions, not their careers.","I see what you're saying. Just because my parents work in law doesn't mean I'm exempt from facing consequences if I break the law. That's up to me and the choices I make in life, not my parents' occupations.","Absolutely, you've got the idea. Now, let's consider other possible scenarios under the same situation. For example, instead of viewing your parents' law careers from a fear-based perspective, can we think about how it might be beneficial for you in your own life? Could it potentially give you a unique understanding of law and ethics, or open door to opportunities that others might not have?","You're correct, I need to shift my perspective. Instead of viewing my parents' profession as something that should protect me from facing legal penalties, I could look at it as beneficial for my upbringing, where I could develop a strong understanding of law and ethics. This could potentially offer me unique opportunities in the future.","I'm really pleased to see you reframing your view like this. Your parents' careers can indeed afford you a unique perspective and potentially valuable opportunities down the line. Remember, we are each accountable for our own actions, and the fact that your parents work in law doesn't predispose you to any outcomes; rather, it's just another part of the rich tapestry that makes you, you. Always strive to make the best choices for you and use the knowledge and ethics you've been privileged to learn about from an early age positively.

948,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,Because I am 7 foot tall I will never be able to find a girlfriend that will date me.,I often find myself feeling lonely and discouraged because I believe that being 7 foot tall makes it impossible for me to find a girlfriend who will be willing to date me.,"I understand that you're feeling lonely and discouraged. It's clear that your height is something you're focusing on. However, it's important to distinguish between the fact of being tall and the thought that this makes it impossible to date. Can we explore this further?","Yes, I would like to explore this further. It's been very difficult for me because I do indeed feel isolated because of my height. I worry that women won't be interested in me because of it.","I can see why you might feel that way, it's not easy feeling different. However, the fact that you are tall doesn't necessarily mean that women won't be interested in you. We all have unique traits that distinguish us from others, and those traits can be attractive to different people. Let’s consider other possible interpretations. Could it be that your height might stand out and draw attention in a positive way? Could it make you memorable or attractive to some? What are some ways your height could be an advantage?",You're right. I suppose being tall does set me apart from others and that could be seen as unique or attractive to some women. It might be a talking point or a reason for someone to remember me. I guess I could also reach things and help others in ways shorter people can't. This is a very different perspective than what I've been used to. I never thought of my height as an advantage before.,"It's great to see you considering these other perspectives. Your height indeed sets you apart, but as you've discovered, that uniqueness can be a positive attribute that can enrich someone's life. Not only can it make you memorable, but it can also open avenues for connection and shared experiences, like helping others reach things. Remember, we all have uniqueness and it’s crucial to embrace ours, it could very well be what makes you attractive to someone. Try holding onto this perspective and see how it changes your interactions and feelings.",
949,Mental filtering,"I played football with my son at the beach, the weather was great but the beer wasn't cold enough, which made the experience bad.","I had an afternoon at the beach with my son playing football, and the weather was absolutely fantastic. However, it was quite disappointing because the beer we brought wasn't cold enough, which really made the whole experience unfortunate.",It seems like you're allowing the temperature of the beer to define your entire experience at the beach. Let's separate the situation here. You had a great time playing football with your son in fantastic weather. The beer not being cold enough is just a small part of that scenario. Can you think of any other ways to perceive this situation?,"You're right. While the beer not being cold enough was a small inconvenience, the real joy of the day was in spending time with my son in the great outdoors. I can see now that the positive aspects far outweighed that minor issue. I should focus more on the good things and not let small disappointments diminish the overall experience.","That's a fantastic perspective! Now, let's think about other possibilities in the same situation. For instance, can we think of how the beer's temperature could have led to some other positive outcomes or opportunities?","Well, the warm beer could have made us explore the local beachfront shops or cafes to buy some cold drinks. That could have led us to try some new drinks or food, or even meet and interact with someone new. It could have led to a different, but still potentially enjoyable, experience.","Absolutely! I love how you're thinking creatively about the situation. The warm beer turned into an opportunity for a new refreshing drink, trying out local cuisine, and perhaps even engaging with interesting people. It's important to remember that perceived setbacks can potentially open up new paths for enjoyment and discovery. Life is full of such small opportunities. By focusing on the positives, you allow yourself to fully appreciate and enjoy even the unanticipated moments.",
950,Discounting the positive,"My mom taught me how to play the cello, but anybody can do it.","I've been thinking a lot about the fact that my mom taught me how to play the cello. It's a skill that I've been proud of, but lately, I've started to question if it's really something special or if anyone could do it.","It sounds like you're feeling unsure about your cello skills. Let's separate the situation from your thought: the situation is your mother teaching you the cello, a skill you're able to do, and the thought is questioning its specialness. Why do you think you're questioning the value of this skill now?","I guess I'm questioning it now because I've seen others pick up the instrument and seem to play it without much effort. It makes me feel like my ability isn't as special as I thought, like it's something anyone can do.","I see, you feel like your accomplishment is undervalued because others also are successful with the cello. But let's consider some other possibilities. Could it be that those people have also spent time and effort in learning to play, just like you did? Or might it be possible that they are naturally inclined to music but can't play as well as you? What other ways could you interpret this situation?","Well, I suppose it's possible that they had prior musical training or natural talent that helped them. They also might've spent a lot of time practicing that I haven't seen. But it's difficult not to compare myself to them. I guess another way to look at it is that even if many people can play the cello, not everyone has the dedication to learn and continue practicing it. That's something I've done for years now, and maybe that dedication is what's special, not just the ability to play.","You've come up with some valuable insights. It's quite true that many can play the cello, but not everyone possesses the dedication and perseverance to learn and continue practicing, which is a unique strength you've exhibited over the years. Rather than comparing yourself to others, focus on that commitment you've shown. That in itself is something extraordinary and special to be proud of. Everyone's journey is different, remember the value of your own.",
951,Labeling and mislabeling,"I work at a hotel, but forgot to check-in two guests, I am a worthless front desk clerk.",I feel really ashamed and worthless right now. I made a mistake at work today and forgot to properly check-in two guests at the hotel where I work. I can't help but think that this makes me a terrible front desk clerk.,"I understand you're feeling upset about the mistake you made, and it's leading you to think negatively about yourself. Let's try to separate what happened from your thoughts about it. So, the situation is that you made a mistake at work and didn't properly check-in two guests. Now, does this situation imply that you are a terrible front desk clerk, or could there be other perspectives?","You're right, when I look at it this way, the situation doesn't necessarily mean I'm terrible at my job. I just made an error, which everyone does from time to time. Maybe instead of judging myself harshly, I should focus on how I can improve and prevent the same mistake from happening again. I could probably use this as a learning opportunity.","Excellent! You've already started reframing the situation positively. Now, let's also consider other possible things that could stem from this situation rather than just a negative outcome. What could be some other perspectives you've not thought about yet? Could there be opportunities or insights that this situation has opened up for you?","That's a good point. In fact, this situation made me realize that I need a better system to track our guests as they arrive. I've been meaning to suggest an improved check-in process to my manager, and this mistake gives me the push I needed. Furthermore, I also now realize that it's okay to ask for help when things get too rushed at the front desk. I don't have to do everything alone, and I can delegate some tasks to my co-workers. So, in a way, this incident has opened up a path for improvement in our processes and teamwork.","I'm really impressed with how you've reframed this situation. Instead of seeing this as a failure, you're looking at it as an opportunity to strengthen your working system and enhance teamwork. That’s a highly constructive and resilient attitude. Making a mistake doesn't make us inefficient or worthless, instead, how we handle it and learn from it truly defines our worth. You have all the necessary skills to handle these situations, so don't hesitate to trust yourself, make the suggested improvements and ask for help when you need it. Keep up with this positive mindset.",
952,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I messed up a couple stitches on my latest sewing project.  It's totally ruined now.,I messed up a couple stitches on my latest sewing project. It's totally ruined now. I feel really disappointed and frustrated with myself.,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed because you've made a few errors in your stitching. Let's first distinguish between your project and your thoughts about it. Are the couple of stitches you've messed up actually ruining the entire project or is it your interpretation of the situation that's causing these feelings of frustration and disappointment?,"You're right, it could be my interpretation of the situation. Maybe I'm overreacting by saying the whole project is ruined because of a few mistakes. I tend to be a perfectionist and it's hard for me to accept when things don't turn out perfectly. I'm feeling disillusioned because I've put so much time and effort into this project.","I can see that striving for perfection sometimes makes it hard for you to accept imperfections. However, let's try to consider other perspectives in this situation. Would your project look any less appealing with these unique 'mistakes'? Or could these stitches be seen as an opportunity to show your progress and learning curve? Maybe those irregularities could add a unique and personal touch to it? What are other possibilities you can think of?","That's an interesting way to look at it. I suppose someone else might not even notice the mistakes or they might even find them charming. I could also see them as a reminder of my progress, like you suggested. Another possibility is that I could use this as a learning experience to improve my skills. Maybe the project isn't 'ruined' after all, but just different than what I had originally planned. It could still be worthwhile.","I'm really impressed with your ability to shift your perspective! You've made a significant point about those 'mistakes' being viewed as charming, or as an indication of your progress. This could indeed be a valuable learning experience which might be more beneficial in the long run than a 'perfect' project. Remember, perfection is not the end goal. Rather, the process, the learning, and the progress you make hold the true value. I encourage you to embrace this mindset; your project is not 'ruined,' it's just uniquely yours.",
953,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I love to read and relax by the lake on the weekends. It rained one day this weekend. The whole trip was ruined.,"I really enjoy reading and relaxing by the lake on the weekends. It's a peaceful and calming activity that I look forward to. But unfortunately, it rained one day this weekend and it completely ruined my trip.","I hear that you're feeling upset because your weekend trip was disrupted by the rain. However, it's important to recognize that the situation – rain occurring – is separate from your thought – the rain ruined your trip. Do you think there is another way to look at this situation?","Yes, you're right, I suppose. The rain didn't necessarily ruin the trip. It was just an unexpected change of plans that interrupted my reading time. Maybe I can see it as an opportunity to find other ways to relax and enjoy my weekend, even if the weather isn't perfect.","That's a great start. I'm glad you're seeing that inclement weather doesn't necessarily ruin your weekend. Let's explore this further. Can you think of other activities you could do to relax and enjoy your weekend when it's raining? Maybe there are indoor activities that you also enjoy as much as reading by the lake, or perhaps there are ways to adjust your outdoor plans to suit the change in weather?","Yeah, now that you mention it, there are other things I can do to unwind. I love reading, period. It doesn't have to be only by the lake. I could curl up with a good book at home when it's raining and that can be just as enjoyable. I also enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, so that's another activity I could do. And I suppose, if I really wanted to be by the water, I could simply bring along an umbrella or a raincoat and maybe find it enjoyable and calming in a different way. Seeing the rain fall on the lake could be a pretty sight.","That's an excellent way of reframing the situation. It's clear that you have many interests and enjoyments beyond reading by the lake, like relaxing with a book at home or cooking new recipes. These can definitely serve as wonderful alternatives when it's raining. I also love your idea of embracing the rain and seeing its beauty if you still longed for the lake, it truly shows your capacity to adapt. Remember, the weather is out of our control, but our experiences and enjoyment of the weekend certainly isn't. So, whether it's reading at home, cooking, or enjoying the rain on the lake with an umbrella, you're capable of creating a relaxing and enjoyable weekend for yourself.",
954,Discounting the positive,"I have my dream job and live in a wonderful city, but since I am in a wheelchair my life is meaningless.","I have my dream job and live in a wonderful city, but since I am in a wheelchair, my life feels meaningless. It's incredibly frustrating to see everyone else around me living their lives without the limitations I have. I feel like my disability is holding me back from truly enjoying and appreciating all the great things I have in my life.","It sounds like you're feeling stuck, like your physical limitations are preventing you from enjoying your life to the fullest. But it's important to remember that your situation, being in a wheelchair, is separate from your thoughts and feelings about your situation. Can we explore that a bit more?","Yes, I am open to exploring this further although it's a bit difficult for me to separate my situation from my thoughts and feelings. My disability is a constant reality for me, affecting every single aspect of my life. But I would like to learn how to deal with these feelings and not let them dictate how I live my life.","I understand that your disability presents unique challenges daily and it makes total sense that it affects your feelings. However, let's think about this together—is it possible that there are other ways to interpret your situation or to manage these challenges that could make your life feel more satisfying? Maybe there are other people in similar situations who've found strategies to cope and even thrive? Just think about any other ways you might be able to view your disability or any positive aspects of your life that your current perspective might be overlooking.","I guess there might be another way to interpret my situation. There are indeed people living with physical disabilities who seem to accept their situation and live fulfilling lives. I have a supportive family, a job that I love, and I live in a great city. I guess focusing more on these aspects of my life could potentially lead to a more fulfilling existence. I've also not taken steps to join any support groups or sought advice from those in similar situations, which could probably help me better deal with my situation too. It seems like I've been focusing too much on my limitations and not enough on my possibilities.","That's a great step forward in reframing your situation. Yes, you have a disability that poses challenges, but you also have many wonderful things in your life that can contribute to a positive and fulfilling life. Focusing on your strengths, your supportive family, your work that you love, and the city you love can help you find satisfaction and joy. Joining support groups and seeking advice from those with similar experiences can be a great resource too. It's not about ignoring your struggles, but rather about acknowledging the complete picture of your life, which includes both challenges and victories. Feeling fulfilled isn't about eliminating challenges, but about learning to manage them while still appreciating what you have. Your insight demonstrates courage and openness to change. Keep exploring and nurturing these positive aspects of your life.",
955,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I was chosen to host Thanksgiving this year. The food is going to turn out awful.,I'm feeling really stressed because I was chosen to host Thanksgiving this year. But I'm worried that the food I make is going to turn out awful.,"I understand your concern. So, the situation is that you're selected to host Thanksgiving this year and your thought is that the food might not turn out well. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I'm really afraid of messing up the food and putting a damper on everyone's holiday.","I see. It's understandable to feel that way when taking up a big responsibility. But let's consider some other possibilities. What if the food does turn out well? Or even if it doesn't, do you think Thanksgiving is only about the food? Could there be other aspects of the event that people might appreciate?","You're right, there's a chance that the food might turn out better than I'm expecting. And even if it doesn't, Thanksgiving is about more than just the food. It's about family, thankfulness, and being together. I think my family might appreciate the effort I've put in, regardless of how the food turns out.","That's an excellent reframed thought! You've really hit the nail on the head there. Thanksgiving indeed is about family and thankfulness. It's often the effort and love that goes into planning such a gathering, rather than the perfection of the food, that people remember and appreciate. Let's focus on those aspects, and remember, even the best cooks have off days. It's all part of the experience.",
956,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,"Because I work at Target in California, I'll never be able to afford to move and live elsewhere.",I've been feeling really stuck lately because of my job. I work at Target here in California and I can't help but think that I'll never be able to afford to move and live somewhere else. It feels like my future is limited because of my current situation.,"I hear your concern. So the situation here is that you work at Target in California, and the thought linked to it is that you believe this job confines your future possibilities. Do you think there could be other ways to see this situation?","I haven't really thought about it that way. I suppose there might be opportunities for growth within the company or possibly other jobs that I could afford to transition into. But it doesn't feel that way, it's like I'm trapped.","That's a good start. So, you've already considered that you may have opportunities for growth within the company, or there could be other jobs out there suitable for you. Let's think more about it - could there be other positives or alternative perspectives regarding your current job? For example, can this job offer you skills or experiences that might be valuable in the future? Or perhaps there are other aspects to your life in California that are valuable, beyond the scope of the job itself. What do you think?","Now that you mention it, I do feel like my job has helped me to develop certain skills that could be useful in other settings. Specifically, I've learned a lot about customer service and even some management aspects. I've also made good friends here, and California has a lot to offer in terms of quality of life. I guess... I shouldn't put all of the emphasis on my job when thinking about my future prospects.","I'm really glad to see that you are acknowledging the skills you've developed in your current job, like customer service and management, which can definitely be transferable to other roles or jobs. It's also wonderful to hear about the positive relationships you've built and the valuable aspects of life in California. It sounds like you're starting to see that your job at Target, while it is a big part of your life, isn't the only factor determining your future. The bigger picture includes your skills, relationships, and quality of life, all of which are important elements. Remember, every situation has different aspects, and it's in your hands to focus more on the positive sides that can uplift and propel you forward.",

I feel like I'm missing out on important moments and milestones in my children's lives. It's stressful and it's taking a toll on my mental and emotional well-being.","It sounds like you're feeling conflicted. The job of being an electrician is financially rewarding, but it seems it's causing you distress because you feel you're missing out on family time. Let's try to separate the situation, which is your job, from your thoughts and feelings about the job. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts this situation is sparking for you?","In essence, when I'm out at work, I often get this gnawing feeling that I'm neglecting my family. I feel guilty for not being there for my kids' activities and my wife, which adds to my stress. Even though I understand that I'm working hard for their future, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm failing them as a father and a husband. I feel torn between my responsibilities.","I hear your struggle with this thought that you're failing your family, which must be really hard. Yet, you're also acknowledging that your work is for their future. Let's explore other possible interpretations of this situation. What are some other ways of viewing your being an electrician and how it relates to your family that could be equally true? For example, could it also be seen as setting a strong work ethic example for your children or showing your family how much you care for them by providing for their needs?
","I haven't really thought about it in that light. I suppose that by working hard and being dedicated to my job, I am setting a good example of responsibility and commitment for my kids. My work allows us to sustain our lifestyle and cater to their needs, which is a way of showing my love and care for them. I recognize these aspects but it's hard to fully accept them as valid owing to the time I'm missing out on with them.","You’re right, and it’s wonderful that you can see how your hard work can serve as a positive example of responsibility and dedication for your children. Being able to provide for your family in a financial way is definitely a sign of love and commitment. It's understandable that you feel you're missing out on time with them. You're not alone in this and many parents feel the same way. But remember, quantity doesn't always mean quality. It's about making the moments you do have with them full of love, attention, and meaningful interactions. Balancing work and family life is never easy, but perhaps reframing it this way might bring some relief to your feelings of guilt. You're doing the best you can in a challenging situation; please remember to be gentle with yourself too.

I was so excited to see them perform live and now I feel like I'll never have the chance to meet them. It's really bumming me out.,I understand that you're disappointed because the band's show got cancelled. That's the situation. It seems you're thinking that this means you'll never get to meet them. That's your thought. Lets work on dissociating these.,"Alright, I understand. Yes, I'm really upset about the cancelled show, and I suppose I've let it make me believe that I will never meet them, although logically I know that's not necessarily true. So, I guess the situation is that the show is cancelled, but the thought that I will not meet them ever is something I've added on my own.","That's a great realization. The show indeed got cancelled – that's the fact. However, it doesn't automatically mean you will never meet them. Let's explore other potential possibilities. Could they possibly reschedule the tour? Is there a chance they may have other shows in cities close by that you could attend? Or maybe there could be other occasions when you might meet them?","You're right. I suppose I was so caught up in my disappointment that I forgot to consider other possibilities. They could indeed reschedule the concert. Also, they tour frequently, so there are chances that they could perform in my city again or in a neighboring city. And there could be festivals or meet-and-greets where I could have the opportunity to meet them. This thought process is indeed helping me feel better.","It's wonderful to see you opening up to other possibilities. You've really turned your thinking around. Remember, a change in plans like a concert cancellation can be disappointing, but it doesn't close all doors. Keep this thinking approach for future circumstances that may seem disappointing at first glance. This positive mindset will not just make you feel better in the current situation, but also strengthen your resilience in the face of future setbacks.",

He has been gone for a few days now, and I can't help but think that something bad has happened to him. I keep imagining that he must have been hit by a car.","I understand that you're feeling worried because your cat has been missing for a few days. But let's try to separate the situation and your thoughts. The fact is that your cat is missing, and what you’re imagining is that he has been hit by a car. These are two different things.","You're right, I'm letting my fears cloud my thoughts. I need to focus on the reality of the situation, which is that my cat is missing. It's possible that something other than getting hit by a car happened to him.","That's a good first step. Let's consider all the possible scenarios. It's possible that your cat went off exploring. Cats are known to be quite adventurous and curious creatures. Maybe he's found a hiding spot or is stuck somewhere, waiting to be found. Sometimes, they also end up in neighbors' houses or find shelter in different places. Can you think of any other possibilities?","Yes, I suppose he might also have been taken in by another family who thought he was a stray. Or perhaps he encountered another animal and ran off to a different neighborhood. There really are a lot of possibilities beyond my initial fear.","That's a significant step forward. It's heartening to see you considering different possibilities. Remember, it's good to acknowledge your fear but don't let it paralyze you. Your openness to other outcomes shows your resilience. Keep holding onto the fact that there are several plausible explanations for your cat's disappearance, many of which aren't harmful. Tracking him down will require patience and effort. Stay positive and hopeful.",
961,Discounting the positive,"I'm a reality TV star, but it doesn't matter because my friends think reality TV is stupid.","I'm feeling really down because I've been questioning my worth and relevance lately. I am a reality TV star, which used to be something I was proud of, but now it feels meaningless because my friends don't seem to value it and think reality TV is stupid. It's making me doubt myself and my decision to pursue this career.","I understand you're feeling low, and it sounds like your friends' opinions about reality TV are impacting how you view your worth and career choice. Let's try breaking this down. You're a reality TV star, and this is a career you chose and were proud of. However, it seems that your friends' reactions have introduced negative thoughts about your worth and career relevance. Am I summarizing that correctly?","Yes, that's exactly it. I used to enjoy being on the show, but their opinions have started to impact me significantly. They often criticize and mock reality TV, and indirectly, me. I've begun to feel diminished and undermined due to their non-appreciation, which has led me to question my choices and self-worth.","I see, it sounds like a difficult situation to be in. Let's try to see this from a different perspective. Could there be other factors that might explain why your friends react to your career the way they do? For instance, maybe they are unfamiliar with the reality TV industry, or they might be struggling with their own issues and projecting their insecurities onto you. Another possibility could be that they do admire your work, but they have a different way of showing it. Can you think of any other possible explanations for their behavior?","Well, you might be right to some extent. A couple of my friends are not that familiar with the industry, so there might be misconceptions. Maybe they do admire my work but are expressing it in a weird way. And, one of them is going through a rough patch career-wise, so I guess there might be a bit of projection. I never looked at it from this angle, but it does give some food for thought.","Absolutely, it’s wonderful to hear you considering alternative possibilities. Often, people's attitudes or expressions have more to do with their own issues or misunderstandings than a reflection of our values. It's important not to let these opinions undermine the value of your work and your self-worth. You are in a unique profession that you once took pride in, which means it holds value and relevance for you. Don't let others' perspective diminish that. Remember, a person's worth is not determined by others' understanding or approval of their profession. So, hold onto that initial pride and confidence you had in your career, it's warranted and well-deserved!",

It's starting to feel overwhelming and frustrating.","It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by the constant need to clean up after your pets. But let's distinguish between the situation you are in - having multiple pets and the thought that it's a burden to look after them. Possibly, is it the thought creating the stress rather than the actual situation? Would that be correct?","Yes, you're right. I guess I am feeling more stressed thinking about the constant mess rather than the actual cleaning up task. It's the thought of constantly having to clean up after them that is more burdensome than the act itself.","Thank you for clarifying that. Now let's consider some alternatives. Cleaning up after your pets is part of the responsibility, for sure. But what might be some other thoughts or perspectives that you can have on this same situation? Can we find something positive or valuable from this scenario or perhaps find a different approach to handle it?","Well, I suppose one positive perspective would be that having pets and taking care of them, which includes cleaning up after them, teaches me responsibility and organizational skills. In addition, I could possibly establish a routine or schedule for cleaning that could help manage things better. Also, by looking after my pets, I'm providing them with a safe and clean environment, which makes me feel good because I love them and want the best for them.","That's wonderful! You've identified the positive aspects of this situation and how it contributes to your personal growth in terms of responsibility and organization. Establishing a routine sounds like a practical approach to managing the cleaning tasks in a more efficient way. Moreover, the love you have for your pets and wanting to provide them with a safe and clean environment speaks volumes about your compassion. Remember, every time you clean up after them, you're creating a healthy space for your beloved pets and that's something commendable. Keep up this positive perspective!",
963,Discounting the positive,"I am a vegetarian, I always receive criticism from people for my diet","I am a vegetarian, and it seems like I always receive criticism from people about my diet.","I hear that you are feeling criticized for being a vegetarian. Let's separate the situation here. Your diet choice is a fact, and the criticism is the reaction you're experiencing from others. The opinions of others are separate from your personal decision. Does this make sense to you?","Yes, it does make sense. I understand that their reactions are not linked to my decisions. Their responses are based on their perception, not necessarily on the validity of my choice.","That's a great realization. Now, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be possible that their criticism is actually due to a lack of understanding or knowledge about vegetarianism? Or perhaps, they might be projecting their own insecurities or unwillingness to change their own diets on you? What other scenarios do you think could be possible?","I suppose there could be a number of reasons. They may not understand the benefits of a vegetarian diet, or perhaps they're uncomfortable with someone making lifestyle choices that are different from theirs. Maybe they themselves have been considering changing their diets but haven't been able to follow through, and engaging in criticism is their way of dealing with that. I hadn't really thought about it from this perspective. It's enlightening.","That's a great insight! Understanding others' reactions can come from diverse and personal reasons, and those reasons aren't necessarily a reflection of your choice. Your decision to follow a vegetarian lifestyle is valid and personal to you. Their responses are about their perspective and not about the rightfulness of your decision. You've done well in considering these new possible perspectives. You don't need to defend or justify your lifestyle choices that are rooted in your personal beliefs and value. Just keep going at your own pace and doing what you think is right for you!",
964,Discounting the positive,I am always complimented on my pencil thin mustache but I it doesn't matter since guys with thick mustaches get even more compliments.,"I've been feeling a bit insecure lately about my pencil thin mustache. People always seem to compliment me on it, but I can't help but compare myself to guys with thick mustaches who seem to get even more compliments. It's starting to affect my self-esteem.","I see that you're feeling insecure because you're comparing your mustache to those of others. However, it's important to separate the situation - you have a pencil thin mustache and you receive compliments on it - from the thought that you're less because others may have thicker mustaches. Let's focus on your situation and your reactions to it.","You're right, I should try to separate the situation from the thoughts. I indeed have a pencil thin mustache and unlike what I think, people do find it good enough to compliment me on it. Before jumping to conclusions, I should reflect on what I have and how it's appreciated by others. Comparing with others is only taking a toll on my self-esteem.","That's a great start, I'm glad you're beginning to see the situation from a different perspective. While we're at it, let's consider some other possibilities. For instance, what if the people complimenting you genuinely prefer the uniqueness of a pencil thin mustache? Or, the fact that your mustache is less common could set you apart and make you more memorable to others. It might even be possible that someone out there wishes they could have a pencil thin mustache just like yours. What do you think about these possibilities?","I hadn't thought about it that way before. You're right, I suppose some people could genuinely appreciate the uniqueness of a pencil thin mustache. And it's true - being less common could actually be a benefit, it might set me apart and make me memorable. As for the possibility of someone out there wishing they have a mustache like mine, it really puts things into perspective. I guess I've been limiting my viewpoint and not considering all possibilities. This definitely gives me a lot to think about.","I'm really proud of the progress you're making in changing your perspective. Remember, the beauty of uniqueness comes from standing out, and your pencil thin mustache definitely adds character and sets you apart. It's okay to admire what others have but it's equally important to appreciate your own unique characteristics. Let these new thoughts guide you, and hopefully, they will start to impact positively on your self-esteem.",
965,Labeling and mislabeling,A publishing company told me that all their positions are full but they don't want me there because I'm socially awkward.,"I just received news from a publishing company that all their positions are filled. However, they also mentioned that they do not see me fitting in with their team because of my social awkwardness. This statement has left me feeling disheartened and uncertain about my abilities.",It sounds like you're equating one company's feedback with your overall fit and social skills in the publishing industry. Is it possible to separate these two things - this specific company's comment and your overall abilities?,"Yes, you're right. I think I'm letting this one company's opinion define my overall social abilities and validity in the publishing industry. There could be other companies out there that appreciate my skills and unique qualities. I need to separate this rejection from my overall potential.","That's a great step forward! Now, let's think about other possibilities. Perhaps this company's culture isn't a match for you and isn't representative of the entire industry. Can you think of other possibilities why they might have given this feedback? And think about some potential positive outcomes that could come from this experience?","You're right, it's possible that the company's culture may simply not be a match for me. It doesn't necessarily mean that I'm socially awkward, but that I just didn't mesh with their particular social dynamic. They could be very extroverted while I might be more introverted and better suited to a different company environment. As for positive outcomes, this gives me an opportunity to seek a company where my unique qualities are appreciated, and I can look for ways to demonstrate my social skills in a more confident way in the future.","I'm impressed at your ability to reframe this situation in such a positive way! Your introspection and acknowledgement of potential mismatches in company culture reveal great emotional intelligence and maturity. You are absolutely right, not every environment suits everyone, and it doesn't invalidate your skills. Take this as an opportunity to find a place where your unique qualities are not just accepted, but truly valued. I believe in your potential and am confident you'll find a better fit soon.",
966,Personalization,I'm currently pregnant with my second child. I'm so irresponsible.,I'm currently pregnant with my second child. I'm so irresponsible.,It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. You're pregnant with your second child and it seems that you're feeling irresponsible. Let's try to understanding these separately. Can you share why you feel irresponsible?,"Yes, I often struggle with managing my duties and responsibilities. With my first child, I have always felt that I could have done much better in many aspects. Now that I'm pregnant with my second one, these feelings of guilt and irresponsibility have doubled. I'm fearful that I won't be able to provide adequate care for both my children.","I hear you, and it's clear you care about your children deeply. But let's consider another perspective. It's possible that the assumptions you're making about your abilities as a mother could be based more on your fear than on reality. Remember, you've already successfully raised one child. Could it also be possible that your experience with your first child has actually prepared you better for your second? You have the advanatge of knowing what to expect, learning from past challenges, and this time around you might be able to manage responsibilities more efficiently. What do you think about this perspective?","I hadn't really considered that point of view. I suppose it's possible that my experience with my first child could be beneficial in raising my second. But the fear and guilt still persist. I constantly worry about not managing to give them both equal attention and love, or not being able to cope with all the responsibilities. It also doesn't help that I often compare myself with other moms who seem to have everything sorted out. It feels overwhelming.","I truly appreciate your honesty in sharing these fears. Raising a child, let alone two, is no small task and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. Your experience with your first child does indeed equip you with knowledge and tools that you didn't possess as a first-time mom. Comparison can often make our fears worse. Remember, just because other moms seem to have everything in control doesn't mean they don't struggle. Each family and each child is unique with its own set of challenges. Using your past experience, focus on your own journey as a parent and remember you're doing the best you can in your circumstances. As you move forward, try to be gentle with yourself, the fact that you worry about being a good mother is testament that you are one.",
967,Should statements,"I am bipolar and can't get along anyone, I should really fix my mental health.",I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's been really affecting my ability to get along with others. I'm starting to realize that I really need to focus on improving my mental health.,"I see you're feeling overwhelmed due to your bipolar disorder and its effects on your relationships. It's good to see your realization about mental health being a priority. Now, let's try and separate the situation from the thought. The situation is your diagnosis and the thought is feeling overwhelmed and finding it hard to get along with others. Is this correct?","Yes, that sounds correct. My diagnosis has definitely made interacting with others a lot more challenging for me, and the fact that I'm feeling so overwhelmed isn't really helping. I just feel like my mental health is spiraling out of control.","Sure, it can feel very overwhelming. But let's brainstorm alternative ways of understanding or viewing this situation. For instance, consider your diagnosis as an opportunity to understand yourself better and develop strategies for managing. Also, remember, your mental health does not define your ability to interact with others. Could there be other possibilities in handling this situation? Maybe seeking professional help or joining support groups could facilitate better interactions and management of feelings for you?","I've never really thought about it in that way. Yes, understanding my condition better might help me manage my feelings and be better in social situations. I've considered seeking help, but I guess I've always been a little afraid. And as for support groups, well, I hadn't even thought about that. That might be a good way to connect with others who are experiencing the same things. You're right, there are other possibilities in handling this situation. I shouldn't limit myself to feeling overwhelmed and helpless.","I'm really glad to see you opening up to those other possibilities. It's great to hear you considering understanding your condition more and seeking professional help, even exploring the idea of support groups. It indeed may not be easy, but it's worth trying. Remember, being diagnosed with bipolar disorder is a part of your life, but it doesn't define you. You have the power to navigate this challenge and find ways to manage it effectively. And you're not alone, there are people ready to provide the support you need. I believe in your strength and ability to handle this. Keep reminding yourself that this is a journey, and every step you take toward understanding and managing your condition is a big accomplishment.",
968,Mental filtering,"I can knit all kinds of clothes, but they're kinda ugly and poorly done.","I've been feeling down lately because I've been knitting all kinds of clothes, but I can't help but feel that they're kind of ugly and poorly done.","I see that you've been knitting a lot and it sounds like you're feeling down about the end results. It's important to remember though that there is a separation between the act of knitting, which is the situation, and the thought of the clothes being ugly, which is your personal perception.","You're right, I see the distinction now. I guess I've been focusing too much on my personal perception and equated it with the fact that I'm not good at knitting. But it's just my opinion, it's not necessarily the reality of the situation. It's hard to separate the two though.","You're doing a great job distinguishing your thoughts from the actual situation! Now, let's consider some other possibilities. What if the clothes you've knitted are seen by someone else? They might have a totally different opinion about them. Could it be possible that you're being a bit too hard on yourself, given that you've been knitting all these different items? What are other ways you could interpret your knitting outcomes?","You're right. I have been rather self-critical and have not considered that others may not see my creations as I do. They might see the effort I've put into my work and appreciate it for what it is. Perhaps I've been expecting perfection from myself when in truth, nothing could ever be perfect. I suppose I could also look at my knitting outcomes as a chance to improve and develop my skills instead of a failure. I feel a lot more optimistic about it now that I've shifted my perspective. Thank you.","Absolutely, you've got the right idea there! It's great to see you starting to view your knitting outcomes as opportunities for growth rather than as failures. Every piece you create reflects the effort and passion you put into it, and it is important to remember that perfection isn't necessarily the goal. It's the progress, the continuous learning, and the joy of the process itself that matters. It's wonderful that you are adopting a more optimistic perspective. Keep on knitting, appreciating your unique creations, and most importantly, enjoying what you're doing.",
969,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,"One of the songs on the new rap album was bad, this album is ruined.",I really didn't enjoy that one song on the new rap album. It completely ruined the whole album for me.,"I hear what you're saying. You didn't enjoy one particular song and it made you feel that it ruined the whole album for you. Let's separate the situation here, you didn't like that one song, which is a fact, from your thought, which is it ruined the whole album.","Okay, I see what you mean. I didn't like that particular song on the album, but that is just one song out of many others. Maybe it didn't entirely ruin the album for me as a whole.","Exactly, let's dig a bit deeper. While it is true that you didn't enjoy one song, there are other songs in the album. Can you think of any other possibilities? For instance, could there be songs you liked or was the album indicative of the artist's growth that you're not used to yet? Could it be that your perception of this single song is affecting your overall experience?","You're right, I might be focusing too much on this one song that I didn't like. Actually, there were several other songs on that album that I really enjoyed and found catchy. And maybe my dislike for that one song is more about me not being familiar with the artist's new direction. Perhaps, I should give it a few more listens before making a final judgment. This single song probably shouldn't sway my overall opinion of the album.","That's an excellent way to look at it. I appreciate how open you're now to experiencing the album beyond just one song. Remember, it's perfectly fine not to love every single song on the album. An artist's growth might take some getting used to. It shows open-mindedness to be willing to give it repeated listens before making a final judgment. Keep enjoying the songs you already like and who knows, you might grow to appreciate the new direction the artist is heading in. That's the beauty of music and personal growth.",
970,Mental filtering,I am graduate student who recently landed a good paying job. Now I can't volunteer as much as I would like to.,"I've been feeling conflicted lately because I recently landed a good paying job as a graduate student, but now I find I can't volunteer as much as I would like to. It's been weighing on my mind and I'm not sure how to navigate this situation.",It seems like you're faced with a challenging situation where you're having difficulty balancing your new job and your passion for volunteering. You're feeling conflicted because these two aspects of your life aren't perfectly aligning right now. Is that accurate?,"Yes, that's right. I find it fulfilling to help others in need and that's why I like to volunteer. On the other hand, the job I've got is essentially a step-up for my career and I can't afford to lose it. But not being able to volunteer as much as I'd like just feels wrong.","I understand where you are coming from. How about looking at other alternatives? Maybe there's a possibility to incorporate volunteering into your life in a different way. Could you possibly look for opportunities to volunteer that require less time, or perhaps get involved in some way after work or on weekends? Or, what about seeing if you can do anything related to volunteering at work, like organizing charity events for your company? Does any of this resonate with you, or can you think of other ways to balance your career and your passion for volunteering?","Yes, I think those are good suggestions. It didn't occur to me that I could combine my work and volunteering like organizing charity events. I can definitely consider doing something along those lines. As well, looking for opportunities to volunteer that demands less time sounds like an acceptable compromise. I'll start researching for such options. Thank you for your guidance.","I'm really glad to hear you found those suggestions helpful. It's excellent that you're open to new ways of doing things and that you're willing to explore alternatives. Remember, your dedication to volunteering and helping others is commendable and reflects your kindness and generosity, and these qualities will continue to shine whether in a formal volunteering scenario or elsewhere. You're on the right path and remember, every little bit counts. Keep exploring these new opportunities, stay flexible and I'm sure you'll be able to find a balance that works for you.",
971,Labeling and mislabeling,My horse never talks back to me. I am such a useless horse trainer.,I've been feeling really down lately because I've been thinking about how my horse never talks back to me. It makes me feel like I'm a useless horse trainer and that I'm not doing a good job. It's been weighing on my mind a lot and I'm not sure how to deal with these thoughts.,"I notice that you're feeling inadequate because your horse doesn't communicate back, which you equate with successful horse training. But let's make sure to distinguish between the situation, which is the horse not talking back, from your thought, that this makes you a poor horse trainer. They're not necessarily synonymous.","I understand what you're saying. I guess I've been linking the horse's lack of response to my skills as a horse trainer. I've been putting the blame on myself, thinking that if I were better at my job, the horse would communicate back. It's harsh, but it's what I've been feeling.","It's great that you're seeing the distinction. Now let's attempt to look at things from a different perspective. Is it possible that a horse not talking back can be explained in other ways, apart from reflecting your skills as a horse trainer? There could be other factors at play here. Can you think of any other reasons why this might be happening?","Yes, you're right. Perhaps my horse is not talking back because he is not in a good mood or he is just not a talkative horse. Maybe he is having a problem I am not aware of yet. I might have been too quick to assume that it's all about my aptitude as a horse trainer. I see now how this assumption has been causing me to feel inadequate. It's not entirely about me but about understanding the nature and the behaviors of the horses as well.","That's an insightful shift in perspective. Horses, much like humans, have their own moods, behaviors, and unique personalities that influence their communication. Not every silent moment reflects on your abilities. It's heartening to see you realize that your skills as a trainer are not solely defined by your horse's response but also your understanding of their nature. Let's continue to explore this path - acknowledging your influence, but also recognizing the independent nature of your horse. With this mindset, you can be a more compassionate and effective trainer.",
972,Overgeneralization,I love playing League of Legends but i keep losing. I will probably not win a game again.,I love playing League of Legends but I keep losing. I will probably not win a game again. It's really discouraging and it's starting to affect my confidence in my abilities.,"I see that you're feeling discouraged because you've been experiencing a series of losses in League of Legends. But I wonder, is the outcome of these games really a reflection of your abilities? Or is there something else going on?","I guess I've been attributing the losses to my lack of skills. It's possible that there could be external factors influencing the game results like, my internet connection, the skill level of the other players, or maybe I've been having off days. I suppose it's not entirely about my abilities.","That's an excellent realization! Aside from external factors, which you've already mentioned, do you think there could be other possibilities? For example, could the losses be opportunities for learning to improve your strategies or teamwork? Or perhaps it might be about gaining enjoyment from the process of the game instead of just focusing solely on winning? Can you think of any other perspectives?","You're right. It did cross my mind once that these losses could be learning opportunities. I do learn new strategies every time I lose. Also, I shouldn't just focus on winning, I suppose. After all, it's a game and it's supposed to be fun. Maybe I've been too caught up with the idea of winning that I forgot to enjoy the game itself. Besides, I should also consider that losing is part of any game, it's not always about winning. I think I need a shift in perspective.","Exactly, you've just reframed your thoughts in a positive and constructive manner. Winning, of course, feels good but learning new strategies and enjoying the process are equally important aspects of gaming. Losses are indeed opportunities to learn and grow. Try reminding yourself of this reformed perspective next time, focusing more on enjoying the game and seeing every outcome as an opportunity rather than a defeat. It's not about winning every game, it's about enjoying, learning, and improving. Keep up with this perspective!",

I often find myself thinking that no matter how much I may love cats, my own behavior might prevent them from ever liking me in return. It makes me feel sad and guilty because I genuinely want to connect with them and have a positive relationship.","It sounds like you're feeling quite upset due to the belief that your behavior might prevent cats from liking you. However, it's important to differentiate our thoughts from our situations. For the situation, you love cats and want to form a bond with them. Your thought, on the other hand, is that your behavior might be preventing this.",You're right. I love cats and want to form a bond with them. That is my situation. My thought is that my behavior might be preventing this. I've been so consumed by this thought that it's impacting my mood and behavior even more.,"I see that you're recognizing the difference between your situation and thoughts, which is great progress. Let's try to think about other possibilities. Could it be possible that your perception of your own behavior is harsher than how others or cats would perceive it? Perhaps cats might not interpret your actions the same way you do. What if in their eyes, you're someone who loves and cares for them? Can we consider these possibilities?","Yes, that's a perspective I hadn't considered. It's a possibility that my perception of my own behavior is not how others see it, even cats. They might not interpret my actions in the same negative light as I do. They might just see me as a person who cares for them. That possibility does make me feel more optimistic.","I'm really pleased to hear you're considering new perspectives, and I have faith you can change how you view this situation. Believing others might see your caring side, including cats, can be a nurturing perspective to carry. Remember, our thoughts are not absolutes. Just like you could consider these alternative views, it's very possible that the cats see your affectionate side after all. Your love for cats is what matters most in building this desired bond. So let's keep exploring this new, more positive outlook.",

I recently received a raise at work, which should have been a great thing. But instead of feeling happy and excited, I find myself feeling overwhelmed and drained. The extra job responsibilities that came with the raise have taken away the joy that I should have been feeling.","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed at work after your recent raise. It's important to separate the situation - the fact that you got a raise, from the thoughts and feelings—they have increased your workload making you feel burdened. Do I understand your situation and thoughts correctly?","Yes, you accurately described how I'm feeling. I do recognize that getting a raise is generally a positive thing, but the resulting increase in my workload has just made me feel overloaded and stressed. It's like any happiness I could have felt is overshadowed by these negative feelings.","I appreciate your openness in expressing your feelings. Now, let's try to explore other possible perspectives of this situation. Could there be any other way to view this raise and the increased workload? For instance, could it be a chance for growth, enhancement of your skills, or maybe even an opportunity to delegate some tasks? Are there any other positive aspects you might be overlooking in this scenario?","I suppose I hadn't really thought about it that way before. I do like the idea of viewing this as an opportunity for growth and skill enhancement. I mean, the increase in responsibilities could potentially help me learn and grow in my career. And I guess it's not entirely unfeasible to consider delegation of some tasks, as long as it's done properly and respectfully. Thank you, I think this new perspective can help me manage my feelings of being overwhelmed.","That's a very insightful way to look at it! Recognizing the raise as not just an increase in workload, but also an opportunity for personal growth and development, can significantly change your outlook. Embrace this as a stepping stone towards valuable career advancement and remember, it's perfectly acceptable to delegate as a means to manage your workload. It's about learning balance and effective management. Thank you for trusting me with your feelings and I believe in your capability to harness this situation positively. You're far stronger and adaptable than you think.",

I think no one wants to date me because I only enjoy going on picnics that are outdoors.,"It sounds like you're feeling rejected because you've been searching for a date for some time now. To clarify, you believe this is due to your preference for outdoor picnics. Is that accurate?","Yes, that's accurate. I feel like my preference for outdoor activities, particularly picnics, is causing people not to want to date me. It's gotten to the point where I feel very rejected and undesired.","I understand you're feeling rejected due to your love of outdoor activities, particularly picnics. However, let's consider a different perspective. Could it be possible that you just haven't found the right person who shares your interest in picnics yet? Or that the people you've met so far may prefer different styles of dating? What do you think about these possibilities?",I guess I hadn't considered that before. Maybe I have just been meeting people who aren't a good match for my outdoor interests. The thought of there being someone out there who also enjoys picnics and the outdoors like I do certainly is comforting. I guess I need to remain patient and hopeful. Thank you for presenting me with this perspective.,"Absolutely! You've hit the nail on the head. Just because you haven't found the right match yet, doesn't mean you won't. Your love for outdoor activities, particularly picnics, is a unique and special part of who you are. It's about finding someone who truly appreciates and shares these same interests.

Let's try to separate the situation from the thought. The fact is, you've grown some tall sunflowers. The thought is, there might be taller ones nearby. Can you see how these two things are not the same?","Yes, I see what you mean. I realize that I have tall sunflowers that I should be proud of and it's a fact. But I am having thoughts and doubts about there being taller ones nearby, which may not necessarily be true. They're separate things.","That's great that you can see the difference. Now, let's imagine other possibilities under this same situation. What if your sunflowers being the tallest in your own garden is in itself a great achievement? Or maybe even if there are taller sunflowers next town over, it doesn't lessen the fact that you've grown remarkable ones yourself? Can you begin to see these different possibilities in your scenario?","Yes, I understand. The height of my sunflowers doesn't need to be compared to the ones in other gardens. It is indeed a great accomplishment that I have sunflowers that are tallest in my own garden. Even if there might be taller ones someplace else, it doesn't take away from the fact that I've done well in growing mine. I see that these are different ways to interpret the situation.","That's absolutely right! By shifting your thoughts, you've been able to reframe the situation in a positive light. You should feel proud of the work you've done to grow such tall sunflowers. Comparisons don't determine the value of your achievements. Remember, every garden is unique, just like yours, and every effort you put into it is what truly counts. It's not about whether there are taller sunflowers elsewhere, but about the joy and satisfaction you get from nurturing yours. Keep believing in this positive perspective.",

I suppose it's about the bigger picture of my overall lifestyle choices, not just a single action.","Exactly, you're on the right track. Everyone has moments of weakness, and it's important we learn from them, not dwell on them. Can you think of how this experience could possibly lead to positive outcomes? Maybe it reaffirms your dedication to veganism, or informs others of the challenges and realities of maintaining a vegan lifestyle?","Yes, I see what you mean. This experience definitely made me realize how committed I am to being vegan. It also made me understand that it's okay if I make a mistake, as long as I learn from it and make better choices next time. It also shows me and other people that veganism isn't always easy, but it's a journey worth taking.","That's a very insightful way to view the situation. It shows resilience and a deep commitment to your choice of being a vegan. Remember, it's not about perfection but progression. This experience has strengthened your commitment and offered a realistic perspective on the journey of a vegan lifestyle. Every step, every choice makes a difference. Keep learning, growing, and sharing your journey with others. We all have our off days and that's perfectly alright.

I also understand that skills take time to develop, and I shouldn't be too hard on myself.","Absolutely, you're on the right track now. Now consider the other aspects of gaming that you enjoy. Is it the thrill of the game's story? Is it the connection with other players? Could it be the challenge that is appealing to you rather than just purely winning? Approaching the game from a different perspective might help you enjoy it more.","Yeah, when I consider those aspects, I realize there's so much more to gaming than just winning. I really enjoy the plot of the games, the sense of adventure and the connections I've made with other players around the world. Focusing on these elements should indeed help me to enjoy the game more. You've given me a fresh perspective that I needed.","I'm really proud of the shift in perspective you've made! Focusing on the aspects that truly bring you joy—the storyline, the sense of adventure, and the friendships you make with other players—that is the real essence of gaming! And remember, skills are built over time, don't beat yourself up if you're not at the level you desire to be at this instant. Enjoy the journey of improvement, one game at a time. Keep going!",
979,Labeling and mislabeling,The cake I baked today got burnt. I'm the worst baker in the world.,"I baked a cake today, but it got burnt... again. I'm starting to think that I'm just the worst baker in the world.",Let's take a moment to look at the situation and your thoughts about it separately. The situation is simply that a cake you baked got burnt. The thought you are having is that you're the worst baker in the world. Does that sound accurate?,"Yes, that's correct. I baked a cake and it got burnt. And every time this happens, I feel like I'm the worst baker in the world.","I understand how you're feeling, and it's okay to feel frustrated. However, let's try to think of some other possibilities. For instance, could it be that you're still learning, and this is just part of the process? Or perhaps, there might be a problem with the oven or the recipe you're using? Would any of these possibilities make sense to you?","Yes, they make sense. But, I still feel frustrated because I've failed multiple times. I want to believe that I'm just learning and the errors are part of the process, but it's hard. Though, I can consider the possibility of an issue with my oven or the recipe. These alternatives do help me feel a little less worst.","I truly understand how you're feeling. Frustration often comes with the process of learning. It's great that you're open to considering other perspectives like the oven or the recipe being a factor. Remember, it doesn't reflect on you as a person or your overall ability to bake. Each experience is a step closer to perfecting your baking skills. Keep going!",
980,Discounting the positive,People in school said I was quiet but everyone else was loud so I doesn't count.,"I feel like people in school always said that I was quiet, but it makes me think that it didn't really matter since everyone else was always so loud.","I understand how you feel, your experience in school has left you feeling that you're overlooked because you're quiet. But, remember, our thoughts are not the same as facts. Just because people perceived you as quiet, it doesn't automatically mean that you don't matter. Now, can you think of any alternative interpretations of the same situation?","Yes, I suppose another interpretation could be that I was misunderstood. Maybe they mistook my quietness for me being disinterested or reserved, when in fact, I was just taking in my surroundings and processing everything. Maybe my quietness was not a flaw but a unique quality that can be appreciated.","That's a great step forward! You were interpreting the environment in your own pace and way, which is completely normal. Apart from being misunderstood, can you think of other ways to perceive this situation? Perhaps that your quietness enables you to listen and understand others more, or that it allows for introspection and thoughtful responses? The same quietness could be interpreted positively by others as well. What other possibilities can you think of?","Yes, I see what you mean. My quietness could have actually been a strength that I couldn't recognize back then. It's possible that my peers saw me as a good listener, someone who they could trust with their feelings and thoughts. Or maybe my quietness allowed me to analyze situations more deeply, leading me to produce thoughtful and well-informed responses in discussions. It's also possible that some people appreciated the calmness that could come from my quiet demeanor in an otherwise noisy environment.","That's an excellent reframing of your past experience! Your quietness is clearly a strength, one that allows you to deeply understand and analyze situations, and provide others with thoughtful insights. Your quiet demeanor can be comforting to others in a world that's often overly noisy and fast-paced. Remember, it's not about how loud one is, it's about the quality of one's words and actions. From what you've told me, because you take the time to listen, reflect, and carefully respond, you bring an important and unique perspective to the table. Celebrate this distinctive quality of yours—it's what makes you, you.",
981,Overgeneralization,One of the kids I tutor didn't do well on a test. They will never pass any of their tests.,I'm feeling really frustrated and discouraged because one of the kids I tutor didn't do well on a test. It makes me worry if they will ever be able to pass any of their tests.,"It seems like you're dealing with a challenging situation with your student's performance and it's causing you some distress. However, it's important to remember that this one test doesn't necessarily reflect your abilities as a tutor or the student's potential. Can you think of other explanations for this outcome?","Yes, I suppose there could be other reasons. The test might have been on a particularly hard topic, or maybe the student was just having an off day. They might also not have studied enough, or their study methods might not have been effective for this particular material.","Absolutely, those are indeed some very plausible explanations. Keep in mind also, everyone learns at their own pace and it's quite normal for students, especially children, to occasionally perform poorly on tests. Maybe the teaching method should be adjusted? Or perhaps there's a need for more practice before exams? It's also a possibility that external factors, like stress at home, are hindering their ability to study effectively. What do you think about these scenarios?","You're right. Now that I think about it more broadly, I realize there could be a multitude of reasons influencing their performance. I've been focusing my attention solely on the outcome of the test, but perhaps I need to pay more attention to the studying and learning process. Maybe I could vary teaching methods to see what works best for them, or find out if there's anything else in their life affecting their focus and performance. I think it would also be helpful to remember that everyone has off days and not to let a single instance drag down my perspective of their potential.","That's an insightful observation! Acknowledging various contributing factors and focusing on the overall learning process rather than just the outcome is certainly a healthier and more productive mindset. In adapting this approach, you're amplifying their potential for success and personalizing their learning process effectively, while also alleviating your own worry. Learning and teaching both are journeys filled with hits and misses. It's heartening to see you stepping up to explore this journey in its entirety, rather than just focusing on the destination. Hang in there and remember, every challenge is an opportunity for growth, both for the student and for you.",
982,Labeling and mislabeling,My cooking was less than stellar. The food came out bland and overcooked. I am such a bad chef.,I'm feeling quite disappointed with my cooking today. The food turned out to be bland and overcooked. I can't help but think that I'm just a terrible chef.,"It seems like you're wrapping up your entire cooking ability with one unsatisfactory meal. Let's take a moment to separate the situation, which is that today's meal didn't turn out as you planned, from the thought that you're a terrible chef. Could you have done something differently today?","Yes, looking back at it, maybe I could have paid closer attention to the cooking times and the amount of seasoning I was using. I let myself get distracted with other tasks and didn't give my full attention to cooking today.","That's a great reflection. So, the situation affected the outcome and not necessarily your overall cooking skills. Now, considering the same situation, can you think of what other possibilities could have resulted if you had perhaps paid full attention and adjusted the seasoning and cooking time adequately?","Yes, if I had given my full attention to the cooking and adjusted the cooking times and seasoning, the food might have turned out much better. It could have been flavorful and well-cooked rather than bland and overcooked. I see now that my distractedness influenced today's cooking, not my overall ability as a chef.","Absolutely, you've hit the nail on the head. Just one instance doesn't define your ability or talent as a chef. Each cooking experience is an opportunity to learn and improve. Your ability to reflect on the situation and understand the factors that influenced the outcome shows that you are conscientious and capable. Keep in mind, even the best chefs sometimes have off days. What matters is the effort to learn from those experiences and do a better job next time. I'm confident you have what it takes to be a great chef!",
983,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I tried to write a book myself and I had no ideas. I will never be an author.,I tried to write a book myself and I had no ideas. I will never be an author.,"It sounds like you're feeling stuck because you're struggling to come up with ideas for your book. However, it's important to remember that your current situation doesn't define your abilities as an author.","Okay, I understand. It's just a temporary situation and doesn't define my ability as an author.","Absolutely! Now, let's think of other possibilities. Every author faces writer's block at times, it's a common situation. Can you think of some other factors that could be interfering with your creativity currently and how you might overcome them? For instance, maybe you need a break, or a change of scenery could inspire you, or reading more books might spark your creativity. What do you think?","You're right, I've been under a lot of stress recently with work, and maybe that's affecting my creativity. I haven't taken much time for myself. I could take a short vacation to a tranquil place to relax and get my creative juices flowing. I also should probably read more to open myself to new perspectives and storylines.","That sounds like a fantastic plan! Stress can indeed block creativity. It takes courage to recognize that and make plans for managing it. Please remember, even the most experienced authors have faced the same situation. Taking a vacation for relaxation and reading more to expand your horizons will not only provide you with inspiration but will also allow your mind to rejuvenate. There's no rush on this journey of becoming an author. Trust in your abilities, take care of your well-being, and let the stories unfold in their own time. You're on the right path.",
984,Discounting the positive,"I scored three goals in my last soccer game, but the other team was missing their best player and anyone else would have scored at least three goals if they were in my position.","I feel proud of myself for scoring three goals in my last soccer game, but I can't help but think that the other team's missing player made it easier for me. I feel like anyone else would have been able to score three goals too if they were in my position.","It's great that you've scored three goals in your last game, that's an accomplishment! However, I notice you're combining this achievement with the thought that it was only possible because the other team was down a player. Let's try to separate these two things. Is it possible that you scored these goals solely due to your own skills and the other team's missing player impacted the game in a different, possibly minor, way?","Yes, I see where you're coming from. It's possible that scoring those three goals was due to my skills rather than the other team's missing player. They may have had an impact but not as much as I was initially thinking. I shouldn't devalue my accomplishments based on factors that are out of my control.","Exactly, you're getting there! Considering alternative scenarios can help us understand this better. For instance, how do you think the game would have played out if the other team had all their players? Could it be that you would still have scored those three goals? How about considering your training and dedication? Could these factors not have contributed more to your achievement, regardless of the other team's situation?","You're right. Even if the other team had all their players, there’s a good chance I would still have scored. I've put in a lot of hard work and dedication into improving my skills, so it's only fair to recognize that those factors played a major role in my achievement as well. I realize now that I might have been selling myself short.","I'm glad to hear that you're recognizing the hard work you've put into improving your skills. It's important to remember that these achievements are a direct reflection of your effort and talent. Even if the other team was down a player, it doesn't take away from what you accomplished. Ultimately, you have demonstrated your skills and you've earned your success, regardless of external circumstances. Keep up your hard work and continue recognizing your own growth and accomplishment!",
985,Should statements,I'm afraid of clowns. They should be illegal.,I'm really afraid of clowns. I think they should be illegal.,"I understand your fear. Let's separate the situation. So, the issue here is with clowns which is causing your fear. Your thought is that clowns should be illegal. Now, it's important we look at these two as separate things. The clowns are not the fear, but your thought about them being illegal is tied to your fear.","I see your point, the fear is tied to my thoughts about clowns, not necessarily the clowns themselves. It's not about making them illegal, I guess. I just really, really fear them.","That's a great first step in understanding your fear. Now, let's think about other scenarios. You mentioned you have fear, which is completely valid. However, what could be other ways to see this situation? What if you saw clowns as performers, or as people doing their job, rather than a source of fear? Are there any other ways you can think of to view clowns that don't cause you fear?","It's difficult but I can perhaps try to see clowns as just people doing a job to entertain and not to scare people. It's just that their appearance causes me panic... Maybe if I focus on their purpose, it might help. But I can't think of any other perspective yet that wouldn't scare me.","That's a courageous step forward in managing your fear. Yes, it will be challenging, but focusing on their intended purpose to entertain, rather than how they look, might dissolve the fear over time. This perspective not only challenges your initial thoughts but also paves the way for more positive encounters. Remember, your fear doesn't define you and it's okay to take small steps towards overcoming it. You're doing great!",
986,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,I asked my friend to refer me to a basketball coach and he said he did not know of anyone. He must think I suck at it.,I asked my friend to refer me to a basketball coach and he said he did not know of anyone. He must think I suck at it. I can't help but feel discouraged and think that I am not good at basketball. It's disheartening to hear that my friend couldn't recommend anyone for me.,"It sounds like you're upset because your friend couldn't recommend a basketball coach for you, and you're interpreting that as a judgement on your basketball skills. ","Yes, that's exactly how I'm feeling. I feel judged by him and it makes me doubt my abilities. In my mind, it's a rejection and it just makes me feel unworthy and unskilled.","I see why you might feel that way. However, let's consider some other reasons why your friend may not have been able to recommend a coach for you. It could be that he genuinely doesn't know any basketball coaches, or he might not feel comfortable making a referral for whatever reason. There could be many reasons that have nothing to do with your abilities. How do you think about these possibilities?","I hadn't really considered those possibilities. Now that you've mentioned it, it's possible he may not know any coaches or maybe he doesn't feel comfortable making referrals. I suppose I shouldn't assume his inability to recommend someone reflects on my basketball skills. It could be entirely unrelated.","That's a major step forward in understanding the situation! It's really vital not to make assumptions about ourselves based on others' actions or replies. We sometimes might misinterpret them and end up hurting ourselves. Remember, your abilities are not defined only by what others think or say. Keep practicing and improving. Your worth and your skills in basketball are inherent to you and do not depend on your friend's ability to recommend a coach.",
987,Mental filtering,"Even though I profited money on my last two trips to Canada, it was so cold I couldn't even focus on how to spend it.","I've been feeling really conflicted about my recent trips to Canada. On one hand, I made some good money, but on the other hand, the extreme cold weather made it nearly impossible to enjoy myself or even think about how to use the money.","I see, you've had a beneficial yet difficult experience. Let's try to unpack this. What you experienced directly was the harsh weather during your trips. The thought that stemmed from this was that it hampered your enjoyment and decision-making. Is that accurate?","Yes, that's correct. Even though I earned good money, the freezing weather had a significant negative impact on my experience and even my thought process.
","Understood. Now, could there be other ways to interpret this situation? For example, could the harsh weather conditions be seen as a test of your resilience or adaptability? Or perhaps, the additional income you've earned could allow you to better provide for yourself or your loved ones, or maybe invest in something you've always wanted. What other perspectives can you think of?","You're right, I didn't see it that way. The cold weather was indeed a test of my resilience and, in a way, helped me appreciate the comfort of my own home. The money I earned can be used to provide a better lifestyle for my family or invest in personal interests, like taking up a hobby I've always wanted to. This perspective does make me see these trips in a more positive light.","That's great to hear! You're absolutely right in seeing that testing your resilience can lead to personal growth, and the benefits of your hard work can positively impact both you and the people you care about. This reframing of your experiences empowers you to find benefits and opportunities in even the most challenging situations. Keep reminding yourself of this, and your perspective towards such instances is likely to be more positive.",
988,Overgeneralization,I got bad grade on my math test the other day. I'll probably fail all of my tests.,I got a bad grade on my math test the other day. I'll probably fail all of my tests.,"It sounds like you're feeling really down about the math test you didn't do so well on. Remember though, one test doesn't define your entire school performance. It's important to distinguish between a single bad grade and the idea of failing all your tests. Let's ponder on this.","You're right, I shouldn't let one test grade define my entire school performance. It's just difficult not to get caught up in the fear of failure. I feel like I'm letting myself down.","I understand that you're feeling disappointment right now and it’s completely okay to have those feelings. It's important, though, to see that there could be other possibilities in this situation. For example, you could consider this test as a learning opportunity. It may point out the topics you struggle with and need to focus on more. Or perhaps, it could motivate you to seek extra help or develop more effective study habits. Can you think of any other ways this situation could be viewed?","Yes, I guess I could see it as a wake-up call to revise my study strategy. Maybe I should reach out for extra help. I could seek tutoring or create study groups with peers. I've never been good with failure, it's difficult to see the positive side of it. But you're right, it can be turned into a learning opportunity.","It's really great to hear you reconsidering your perspective on this issue. I can understand why failure feels difficult, but remember, everyone has setbacks. The key is turning them into stepping stones towards progress, rather than a stumbling block. The adjustments you've thought of, like seeking tutoring or forming study groups, are excellent strategies. They reveal a proactive approach to overcoming challenges. It's okay that you've been struggling. This does not mean you are destined to fail all tests. Use this experience to grow and adapt. You have the ability to overcome this. Remember, it's not about the fall, but how we pick ourselves up.",
989,Labeling and mislabeling,I love to read books because I'm a pathetic loner with no friends.,I love to read books because I'm a pathetic loner with no friends.,"It sounds like you enjoy reading books, and you're feeling lonely. These are two separate situations. Would you agree?","Yes, I suppose you're right. I do enjoy reading books, but I also feel very lonely frequently.","That's a good insight. Now, let's think about this - could there be other possibilities? For instance, you love reading books. Could this passion also be a way for you to connect with people and make friends? Are there any other possibilities under this situation that you may have overlooked?","Well, I never actually thought about it that way. Perhaps I could join a book club or some online communities centered around reading. That might help me connect with others who share my interests. Yes, that could make a difference.","That's a fantastic idea! It's really wonderful that you're open to exploring these new options. Your passion for reading can definitely be a bridge to connect with others who share your interests. Joining a book club or an online community can provide an engaging way to make new friends. Remember, it's perfectly fine to enjoy alone time with a good book, but if you feel lonely, reaching out through these platforms can help. Keep seeing the possibilities within your passions!",
990,Discounting the positive,My cats are very heathy but pet cats are supposed to be healthy.,"I've been thinking about my cats a lot lately and how healthy they are. It's something that I'm grateful for, but it also makes me wonder if all pet cats are supposed to be healthy.","It's wonderful that your cats are healthy. However, it's good to keep in mind that just like humans, every cat has a unique health condition. Do you think it's possible that not all cats are the same in terms of health?","Yes, you're right. Now that I think about it, it's just like humans. Not all cats can be the same in terms of health. I suppose I've just been overthinking because I love my cats a lot and want the best for them.",I can see that you truly care for your cats and their well-being. This caring nature of yours is a strength. Let's harness that. Can you think of other ways you can ensure that your cats continue to stay healthy and happy? What about focusing not just on their physical health but also their mental well-being and happiness?,"Yes, that's a perspective I've not considered before. I can provide more than just physical health for them. I can play with them more, give them more attention, and ensure I provide a loving and stress-free environment. That would certainly contribute to their overall well-being and happiness. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, it gives me a new and positive goal to focus on.","That's a great realization! Your cats are lucky to have a loving caregiver like you who is invested in their overall well-being. Fostering a loving and joyful environment is indeed a wonderful way to enhance their health, both physically and mentally. I encourage you to continue exploring such compassionate approaches. Keep in mind, your love and care for them can go a long way in ensuring their happiness and healthiness.",
991,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,My boyfriend must really think i'm a loser for working in a movie theater.,I've been feeling really self-conscious about my job lately. I can't help but think that my boyfriend sees me as a loser for working in a movie theater.,"It sounds like you're feeling quite insecure about your job and worried about how your boyfriend perceives it. Let's dissociate the thought. The fact here is that you're working in a movie theater. However, the belief you've formed is that this makes you a 'loser' in your boyfriend's eyes. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I feel like he judges me for my job, even though he never said anything directly. But I just assume and it's making me anxious.","I can understand why you might feel that way. It's easy to make assumptions based on our own insecurities. Let's try another way. Can you think of other possibilities? Maybe he's actually proud of you for holding a job, or perhaps he doesn't see your job as a measure of success. What else might be possible in his perception?","You're right, I had not thought about it that way. Maybe he just sees me as a hard worker, someone trying to make ends meet. Or maybe, like you said, he doesn't measure success by the kind of job I have. It's possible he values me for other things, like my loyalty, kindness, or intelligence. That gives me a different perspective.","That's a great reflection! It sounds like you've identified other ways that your boyfriend might be seeing you - as a hard worker, a kind person, someone who is loyal and intelligent. These are all valuable qualities that aren't determined by your job. It's important to remember that we are more than just our work, and that people who care about us, like your boyfriend, likely see us in the same way. Try to hold onto this alternative perspective whenever you begin to feel self-conscious about your job. See if it helps to ease those feelings of self-doubt and anxiety.",
992,Catastrophizing,I like drinking red wine sometimes  probably because i am an alcoholic and have issues i think i am going to go to rehab next week,"I have been thinking that I like drinking red wine sometimes. However, I also feel like this might be a sign that I have a problem with alcohol. I believe I might be an alcoholic and have some underlying issues that need to be addressed. I've been considering going to rehab next week as a way to seek help and make positive changes in my life.","You've mentioned that you enjoy drinking red wine occasionally, and this has led you to worry about having a problem with alcohol. It's important to separate the situation - enjoying red wine sometimes - from the thought that this might equate to being an alcoholic. Let's focus on the actual behaviors and the feelings linked to them first.","You're right. I have been associating my liking for red wine with a potential alcohol problem and it's causing me some worry. When I look at my behavior, it's not that I drink excessively or find it hard to control my urge to drink. I just enjoy it sometimes. It's the thoughts and fears about what this could mean that's creating this stress for me.","It's great to see you reflecting on this. Given that you enjoy red wine occasionally and you do not find it hard to control your urge to drink, it's important to consider alternate possibilities. Many people enjoy a glass of wine without underlying problems. Could it be that you're simply a casual drinker who appreciates the taste of red wine? Or perhaps, are you concerned because of societal perceptions around drinking? Brainstorming other interpretations can help shift the perspective.",I never really considered that I could simply be a casual drinker who enjoys the taste of red wine. I suppose societal perceptions and my own fears could be blowing things out of proportion in my mind. I don't display signs of losing control or harming myself or others. Maybe I'm much harder on myself than I need to be. I think there's a balance that I need to find where I can enjoy things I like without making negative associations in my mind. Thank you for opening up this alternative perspective.,"You've demonstrated great insight and self-awareness in exploring other possibilities. It's absolutely okay to enjoy things you like, like a good glass of red wine, without automatically associating it with negative connotations. Society often influences our perceptions, but being able to balance between enjoyment and overindulgence is the key. Remember, it's about moderation and self-control. You're working to understand yourself better, and that's a significant first step. Keep working on being kind to yourself, acknowledging your feelings, and maintaining a balanced perspective.

993,Should statements,I should be married and not have to go to Disney World by myself.,I feel a sense of sadness and loneliness when I think about going to Disney World by myself. It makes me feel like I should be married and experiencing these moments with someone special.,"It's understandable that you associate happiness at Disney World with sharing it with someone special. However, the situation here is simply going to Disney World, and the thought you're having is about feeling lonely. The two do not inherently go together. We can explore other perspectives on this.","Okay, I can see where you're coming from. It's true, my loneliness is just a feeling and not necessarily tied to the reality of going to Disney World by myself. Let's explore other ways of looking at this situation.","That's a great start! Now, let's consider some other possible experiences you may have at Disney World. Could you, perhaps, imagine the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want without pressure from others? Or even the potential to meet new people who share a common interest in Disney? What other possibilities come to your mind?","You're right! I hadn't thought about the freedom aspect. The idea of being on my own schedule, experiencing the park at my own pace does sound appealing. And there's a chance I could meet fellow Disney enthusiasts, which could make for some enjoyable interactions. I could even potentially make some new friends.
","That's an excellent way of reframing the situation! It's great that you've been able to recognize the potential for freedom and new friendships in what initially seemed like a lonely trip to Disney World. Now, the same trip is an exciting opportunity waiting to be explored, showing just how robust you are mentally. Remember that it's not about waiting for the perfect scenario, but experiencing and enjoying the situation at hand. Keep this perspective with you, and it'll help you in many walks of life.",
994,Discounting the positive,"I work in a hospital, I'll never save enough lives.","I work in a hospital, and sometimes I can't help but feel like I'll never be able to save enough lives. It's overwhelming to think about all the suffering and the limited impact I can make.","It sounds like your work in the hospital is causing you a lot of distress. Let's try to separate this into two parts: the situation, which is your role in the hospital, and your thoughts, your feeling of not making enough impact. What are some facts about your role and what are some thoughts you have about it?","Facts about my role include, I am a healthcare worker and my job is to provide care to patients to the best of my ability. I have saved lives before and my work contributes to the overall functioning of the hospital. 

My thoughts are more emotionally charged. I frequently feel overwhelmed by the number of sick patients that I see every day. I worry that no matter how hard I work, I can't save every life. I feel distressed when I lose a patient and it makes me question my abilities and worth in my role.","I understand how the emotional weight of your role can be overwhelming. Having those thoughts is very normal, especially given the intensity of your work. However, let's explore some other possibilities. What might happen if you were to shift your focus from the lives you can't save to the ones you've positively impacted? Or consider the potential positive ripple effect of every patient you've helped, not just those whose lives were hanging in the balance? Can you imagine how those perspectives might alter your feelings of distress and doubt?","If I switched my focus to acknowledging the lives I've positively impacted, I might feel more accomplished. I'd probably realize that although I can't save everyone, I am still making a difference in many lives. Considering the ripple effect you mentioned, the patients I've helped could've gone on to positively impact other people's lives as well. This does help to alleviate some of my feelings of distress, and it makes my contributions feel worthwhile. However, I think I would still struggle with the deaths I cannot prevent.","I completely understand how the inevitable losses can leave you feeling distressed. It's clear you care deeply about your patients, which speaks volumes about your commitment and compassion as a healthcare worker. Remember, it is this very compassion that drives you to help and heal. Being distressed by loss is human, and it shows your empathy. However, recognizing your profound impact, not just in saving lives but also in improving them, can be a source of strength. Allow yourself to hold both truths - the joy of the lives you've touched and the sorrow of those you couldn't save. This balance can help shift your perspective and bring a sense of peace and purpose amidst the challenges.",
995,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,"My sister plays guitar, she thinks I am lame because I cannot play an instrument.",I feel really discouraged and inadequate because my sister plays guitar and I can't play any instrument. It's like she sees me as being boring or lame because of this. The pressure to be musically talented is getting to me.,"I can see you're feeling down. Just to clarify, the situation here is that your sister plays the guitar, and you don't play any instrument. But your thoughts are that this makes you look boring or lame in her eyes, and feel pressured. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I feel like I'm constantly being compared to her. I feel inferior simply because I can't play an instrument. It's really affecting my self-esteem and confidence.","It's understandable that you're feeling this way, but let's consider some other possibilities. Is it possible that your sister doesn't judge your worth based on whether or not you can play an instrument? Could your skills and talents lie in a different area that's equally as valid and important as her musical ability? We all have different strengths. What are some other things you're good at, other than playing instruments?","You're right, maybe I am assuming too much about what my sister thinks. But it's hard, you know? As for my strengths, I am quite good at drawing and I love reading. I have always thought that those were lame hobbies compared to playing an instrument. I guess because they seem so solitary and inward, while music is something that you can share with others so easily.","It's wonderful that you're realizing your own thoughts might have influenced how you see the situation. And it's fantastic that you're good at drawing and you enjoy reading! These are by no means lame hobbies. They're talents in their own right, and just as valuable as being able to play an instrument. While these may be solitary activities, they also contribute to a deeper understanding of yourself and the world, which is really special. Remember, you don't need to compare yourself to others. Your worth is not based on how similar or different you are from your sister, but on who you are as an individual. You are unique and valuable in your own right.",
996,Should statements,"I can't believe that the people who work with me actually eat animal flesh, they should all be vegans like me if they're working with animals.","I can't help but feel frustrated and disappointed when I see my coworkers at the animal shelter consuming animal flesh. I believe that if they truly cared about animal well-being, they would adopt a vegan lifestyle like me.","I understand how you're feeling. You care deeply about animals and it's hard for you to see your co-workers not sharing the same dietary choices. However, it's important to understand that each person has different viewpoints and beliefs, and consuming animal flesh doesn't necessarily mean they don't care about animal well-being. This is the situation. Now, let's talk about your thoughts around it.",I am having difficulty reconciling my views on animal rights with those of my colleagues. I strongly feel that they do not care about animal well-being as much as I do since they continue to consume animal flesh. This disparity in our perspectives causes a lot of stress and discomfort for me.,"I understand your distress. It's really tough when your deeply held beliefs seem to be in conflict with those around you. Now let's try to look at some other possibilities. Could it be that your coworkers express their care for animals differently, perhaps by focusing more on their immediate care at the shelter than about their diet? Or maybe some of them are even unaware about the impact of their dietary choices on animals and the environment. What do you think about these possibilities?","I suppose it's possible. I just assumed that they didn't care enough about animals or they would make the same choices I did. I never considered that they may not fully understand the impact of their diet choices on animal well-being or the environment. Maybe they do care, but in a different way, focusing more on the immediate care of animals. This gives me a new perspective to consider.","That's a great step forward in broadening your perspective! It's crucial to recognize and respect that people can show care in different ways, and it doesn't necessarily have to align with our own methods. For instance, your coworkers' dedication to providing immediate care to the animals at the shelter shows they do care about animal welfare. Maybe in the future, you could consider educating them about the impact of dietary choices on the environment and animals in a non-judgmental way. This will allow for dialogue and understanding. Remember, change is a process and it often doesn't happen overnight.",
997,Overgeneralization,The photos of my dog aren't coming out well. She's always going to make a poor model.,"I've been trying to take some photos of my dog, but they never come out well. It's frustrating because she's just not a good model.","It sounds like you're having a hard time taking photos of your dog and you're feeling frustrated about this. Let's separate the situation from your interpretation. So, the situation is that you're trying to take photos of your dog. The thought you're having is that your dog is not a good model. Is that correct?","Yes, that's correct. I just can't seem to take a good photo of her. It's like she's always moving or not looking at the camera. It feels like she's a poor model.",I understand that you're finding it tough to capture a good picture of your dog. Can we try to think of some other possible reasons why this might be happening? Could it be that perhaps she's energetic and finds it fun to move around a lot? Or maybe she's not used to the camera and finds it unfamiliar? What are some other possibilities you can think of?,"Well, she is a very active and playful dog, so it's possible that she just can't sit still for a photo. And she might also be a bit unfamiliar with the camera and it could be making her nervous. Maybe I could try playing with her a bit before trying to take her photo, that may help her to relax.",That's a valuable thought process you've gone through there. You've recognized that her active nature and possible nervousness around the camera may be influencing the results of the photos. You've also come up with a practical solution to help her relax before a photo session. Recognizing these dynamics and your willingness to change your approach is a great start for a more fruitful photo session with your dog. keep it up!,

That just proves I'm a horrible baker who will never get better.","I like cooking, but last weekend I burned a batch of cookies. That just proves I'm a horrible baker who will never get better.","It seems like you're blending one specific incident, burning a batch of cookies, with a broader judgment about your overall baking skills. These are two separate things. Could you try to see them separately?","Yes, you're right. I did burn a batch of cookies, but that's one mistake and it doesn't mean I am generally a horrible baker who will never get better.","That's a great realization! Now, let's see. Could we consider any other interpretations of this situation? For example, could it be that everyone makes mistakes sometimes or it was just an off day? Maybe it's a chance for you to learn and improve? What do you think?","Yeah, when I think about it that way, everyone does have their off days and mistakes are quite common. Maybe it was just not my day. Also, this could be an opportunity for me to learn from my mistakes and consequently improve my baking skills.","That's a fantastic perspective! Indeed, everyone has off days, and mistakes are part of the process of learning and growing. Remember, even the best bakers have burned a batch before. Use this as a stepping stone towards becoming even better at something you love, like baking. Keep trying, keep learning and most importantly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's through these experiences that we truly grow.",
999,Labeling and mislabeling,I wasn't able to lift as much weight this week. I am a terrible body builder.,I wasn't able to lift as much weight this week. I am a terrible bodybuilder.,"It sounds like you're disappointed because you were not able to lift as much weight this week. However, it's important to remember that everyone has ups and downs in their performance. Just because this week didn't go as planned, doesn't necessarily mean you're a terrible bodybuilder. Could there be another way to look at this situation?","Maybe I'm just having a bad week, my body might be more tired than usual and not reflecting my true strength. I shouldn't chastise myself so much, even the best bodybuilders have their off days.","That's a great start! It's absolutely normal to have off days, and your performance can indeed be affected by many factors such as fatigue, diet, or even stress. Can you think of any other factors that might have affected your training this week?","Yes, now that I think about it, I haven't been eating as well as I usually do this past week. I've been rather busy and stressed with work, not getting enough sleep either. Maybe all of this has piled on and affected my performance at the gym.","Absolutely, it sounds like you've identified some important factors there. Remember that nutrition, stress, and sleep greatly influence your performance and energy levels. It's okay to have an off week. What truly matters is your commitment and the efforts you are putting in. Keep focusing on your overall journey rather than one rough week. You're not a terrible bodybuilder, rather, you are someone who is dedicated and is willing to understand and adapt to the needs of your body. Keep it up!",
ocess. Maybe I need to prioritize my work better or develop more efficient methods to manage my time. When I think about it, I do appreciate the times when I can just relax or spend time with friends a lot more now than before because it's a rarity. Perhaps I could look at this as a time in my life where personal growth and resilience are being tested and developed. On a positive note, this job is providing me with security so there are definitely benefits there. It's all about finding the right balance, isn't it?","It's great to see you exploring new perspectives! You've thought through this well - personal growth, resilience, time management skills, and to not forget, job security; these are indeed positives from your current situation. Yes, finding that balance is key, it may seem challenging now, but remember, every challenge is an opportunity for growth. Investing your energy into finding efficient ways of working, prioritizing tasks or maybe even setting boundaries could open up more time for you. Keep the focus on self-care and social interactions, they're important to maintain good mental health. You're on the right path, keep going!",

It's really taking a toll on me, and I'm constantly feeling tired. I'm not sure how to cope with this level of exhaustion.","I understand you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted due to your new job. Your situation here is the new job with its demands. Your thought, however, is feeling incapable to cope with the exhaustion. Can we work on separating them and perhaps look at other ways to perceive this situation?","Yes, we can. I'm willing to look for a way to cope with this situation. I believe the exhaustion is just a result of adjusting to a new job, and I want to be able to handle it more favorably.",That's a great starting point. Let's think about other possibilities. Could this exhaustion possibly be a phase during your adjustment period to the new job that will eventually pass? What if the current workload is a chance for you to demonstrate your capabilities and improve your skills? Or could this be an opportunity for you to practice good time management and self-care to ensure balance? What do you think could work best for you?,"I guess you are right. This exhaustion could indeed be a temporary phase. Thinking this way does ease some of the stress, and I feel less overwhelmed. I also do see this as an opportunity to showcase my capabilities and learn new skills. However, I'm still struggling with time management and self-care. I think developing better habits in these areas could make these demanding work hours more manageable for me.","That's a very constructive and empowering way of looking at it – just the kind of reframing we're aiming for. It's absolutely okay to struggle with time management and self-care initially. I want to appreciate your willingness to identify these as potential areas for growth. These skills will not just help you tackle your current situation but add great value in the long run as well. Let's continue to work on strategies that will assist in building these skills.

I think I'm going to have high blood pressure due to the large intake of sodium from the hamburgers.,"It's great that you're recognizing what you enjoy, which is eating hamburgers. However, you're connecting this directly to the possibility of getting high blood pressure from sodium intake. Let's try to separate your enjoyment of hamburgers from your fear of high blood pressure.",Alright. I enjoy eating hamburgers but I am anxious about the potential of getting high blood pressure due to the sodium intake.,"I can understand your concern about the health implications. Can you think of other ways you can still enjoy hamburgers without posing significant risk to your health? For instance, could there be healthier versions of hamburgers or could you manage the frequency of indulgence?","Yes, I suppose I could try to find healthier versions of hamburgers or limit my consumption to once a week to reduce sodium intake. I could probably make some modifications like adding more veggies and choosing leaner meat.","That sounds like an excellent strategy! You’re showing great ability to brainstorm alternative solutions. By opting healthier versions and limiting the frequency of intake, you can enjoy what you love while also taking care of your health. It's all about finding a balance that fits with your lifestyle. You're making a positive change! Keep it up!",
775,Overgeneralization,my son was tackled his football game last night. He's going to wind up with a closed head injury and be unable to work one day.,I'm really worried about my son after what happened at his football game last night. I can't help but think that he might end up with a closed head injury and won't be able to work in the future. It's really taking a toll on me.,"It sounds like your son's accident at the football game is causing you a lot of worry and you're imagining the worst-case scenario right now. Let's separate what actually happened from future assumptions that are causing anxiety. Reality right now is that your son had an accident during a football game, correct? Everything else after that is just anxiety provoking thoughts, isn't it?","Yes, you're right. My son did get tackled during the game, but he seemed ok afterwards. I guess I've just been letting my worry get the best of me and imagining all these worst-case scenarios. It's hard not to jump to conclusions when it's your own child.","I completely understand, as a parent, it's natural to worry about the worst-case scenarios when it comes to your child. However, since he seems okay after the match, let's think about other possibilities which are not as drastic. For instance, it's possible that it was just a minor injury, right? Or it could also be a normal part of the sport that your son recovered from quickly. Can you think of any other potential outcomes as well?","Yes, you're right. There could be many other possibilities. I'm sure he's stronger and more resilient than I give him credit for. Maybe he just needs to rest a bit and gradually get back into the game. And perhaps with proper precautions and safety gear, he can protect himself better in future games. I should also trust in the regular check-ups and medical team that supports the team.","You've really made some positive strides in reframing your concerns about your son. It's wonderful to see you acknowledging your son's resilience and strength, and considering pragmatic measures such as rest, precautions and the role of the medical team in supporting him. You're absolutely correct that such measures can significantly protect him during future games. Remember, it's natural to worry, especially as a parent. But it's also important to trust in our children's abilities and the infrastructure set up to care for them. Let's focus on supporting him in those practical ways while also taking care of your own emotional wellbeing. You're doing a great job.",
776,Personalization,My girlfriend said no when I proposed to her. It is because I am not good enough for her.,I feel devastated and rejected because my girlfriend said no when I proposed to her. It makes me believe that I am not good enough for her.,"I understand that you're feeling devastated and rejected right now because your proposal didn't go as expected. However, let's try to separate the event from your thoughts. The event here is that your girlfriend said no when you proposed. The subsequent thought you're having is 'I'm not good enough for her.' These are two different things - the situation and your interpretation of it.","I have never thought about it that way, but yes, you are right. My interpretation of the situation is making me feel this way. But I can't help but feel that her rejecting my proposal means that she thinks I am not good enough for her. I feel so low and unworthy right now.","Yes, it can be very tough when someone doesn't react the way we'd like them to. But there could be many other possibilities as to why she said no. Perhaps she's just not ready for such a big commitment yet or she may have some personal issues to deal with before she can consider marriage. Maybe she loves you but has some fears or doubts that need to be addressed. It's important to remember that her 'no' could mean many things, and it may not necessarily be a reflection of your worth or how she feels about you. Would it be possible to consider these other perspectives?","I understand what you're saying, and it makes sense. Maybe she does have her own issues she's dealing with. It's just really hard not to take it personally and feel like I'm not good enough, but I'll try to consider these other perspectives. Thank you for showing me a different way to look at the situation.","I really appreciate your resilience and openness to consider these alternative perspectives. It's completely normal to feel hurt in such situation, but remember, her response might have more to do with her own thoughts and feelings than it does with your value or worthiness. You are good enough just as you are. Try to communicate with her and understand her side of the story, it can offer you more clarity. Life often throws us these curveballs to help us grow and learn. I believe in you and I'm here for you.",
777,Personalization,We are starting back to school and I fear that this year's 8th grade students will be violent and dnagerous.,I'm feeling really worried about starting back to school because I have this fear that the 8th grade students this year will be violent and dangerous.,It's understandable that you are feeling worried about going back to school. It seems like you're equating the idea of going back to school with the fear of potential violence from 8th graders. Is that a fair understanding?,"Yes, that's completely accurate. I am really afraid about the potential for violence from the 8th graders this year.","I see. It can be quite unsettling to think about potential violence at school. However, let's consider the scenario from some other perspectives. Could there be a possibility that the eighth graders are feeling similar anxieties about starting school? Or perhaps they might be focused on their academics or friendships, rather than behaving violently? Can you think of any other possibilities?","You're right. Maybe they are also anxious about starting a new school year and are more concerned about their studies and relationships. And yes, there could also be a possibility that they behave well rather than violently. It's just that the idea of potential violence has been so rooted in my mind that it blocked me from seeing other angles.","That's a wonderful reflection. Acknowledging fear is the first step towards overcoming it. The anxiety you're feeling is natural, but it's essential to remember that there can be several different scenarios that could play out. It's great to see that you're open to considering these different possibilities. Remember, not all 8th graders will act violently, just as all people don't behave the same way. Our thoughts can greatly influence our perception of reality, let's keep exploring more positive ideas and maintaining an open mind. Keep up the good work!",
778,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,I love to listen to country music. I bet people are mad at me for that because I am a reality tv star.,I love to listen to country music. I bet people are mad at me for that because I am a reality TV star.,"It's great that you express your love for country music. Remember, being a reality TV star and enjoying country music are two separate aspects of your personality. Why do you think people might be mad at you for this choice?","I feel like being a reality TV star, most people expect me to conform to certain norms or standards, like having tastes in music that are popular or trendy. Country music isn't exactly mainstream and often gets stereotyped. So, I'm worried that my liking for country music will bring criticisms or judgments from people, especially my fans, and society in general.",I understand your concern about possibly not meeting fans' expectations. But let's consider some other possibilities. What if your love for country music is actually appreciated by your fans? Isn't it possible that they might respect you more for being authentic and having unique tastes in music? Isn't it also possible that you could inspire others to explore different types of music and be more open-minded about their choices? What other outcomes can you imagine?,"Yes, I suppose it's possible that my fans might appreciate my authenticity and diverse taste in music. Maybe this could even make me more relatable to those who also enjoy country music but feel judged because it's not widely accepted. I could potentially normalize this music preference and help fans who also enjoy it feel less secluded. Also, my choice could perhaps encourage others to explore country music or understand that it's okay to love something that isn't necessarily mainstream or popular.","That's truly insightful! It's not just about country music, but about giving people courage to embrace what they truly enjoy, no matter how 'unpopular' it may be perceived by others. I believe your fans would indeed appreciate your authenticity and you could very well become a source of inspiration for them to follow their personal tastes without fear of judgement. Always remember, it's your character that people admire, and that encompasses all your unique preferences, including your choice of music. Instead of worrying about how people will react, why not embrace your love for country music and share its beauty with your fans?",
779,Overgeneralization,"I drank too many martinis when I was out with the girls, they'll think i'm annoying for forever.",I had a night out with my friends and ended up drinking too many martinis. Now I can't stop worrying that they will think I'm annoying and won't want to hang out with me anymore. It's making me feel really anxious and insecure.,"It sounds like you're feeling very anxious about that night out. It's important to separate the event - you drinking too many martinis - from the thought that has arisen from it, which is you worrying that your friends found you annoying and don't want to hang out with you anymore. Both are not inherently connected.","You're right, I guess I'm just assuming that they found me annoying, but no one has actually said anything to me. I'm making a connection out of my own insecurities.",I'm glad you're seeing this from a new angle. Keep in mind that your friends also might have been enjoying the night and were not bothered by your behavior. They could have simply seen it as a person letting loose and having fun. Can you think of other possibilities in the same scenario?,"Yes. I suppose they might also have had a few drinks and were too busy enjoying themselves to notice if I was a little more buzzed than usual. Or they might have just thought I was in a particularly lively mood. It's also possible that they might have been concerned for me, not annoyed. I guess there are many different possibilities.","That's fantastic, you've just recognized some very plausible alternatives. Remember, more often than not, people are more forgiving and understanding than we give them credit for. We all have nights where we may let loose a little more than usual. It doesn't necessarily cause our friends to think less of us. Embrace these new perspectives when feeling anxious about the incident.",

I guess I'm too stupid to be a lawyer, unlike my parents.","It sounds like you are feeling very disappointed right now because of failing the bar exam. However, it's important to separate the situation - failing the exam, from the thought - considering yourself as stupid. How about we try to look at this from a different perspective?","Alright, I'm open to trying a different perspective. I just feel so beaten down right now.","I'm glad you're open to look at this differently. Now, not passing the bar exam doesn't automatically mean being stupid. Can we consider other possibilities here? Maybe the way you studied wasn't effective or the exam might have focused on areas you are less familiar with. Or perhaps, you were under more pressure because your parents are lawyers? What do you think could be some reasons?","You might be right, honestly. I did feel a lot of pressure because both of my parents are successful lawyers and it felt like I had big shoes to fill. I also had a lot of distractions while studying. Perhaps it's not about my intelligence, but more about the circumstances and the way I prepared.","You've made some great insights here and I am truly proud of you for being open to reconsider your situation. It seems you understand the pressure you've been putting on yourself due to your parents' achievements and acknowledge that distractions may have influenced your study routine. Remember that failing an exam does not define you or your capability. Choice of preparation and handling pressure may be areas to explore and improve upon for next time. You have the ability to pass this exam, it's just about finding the right approach. You're on the right path to overcoming this obstacle.",
781,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I hate beer and i do not think i will ever like alchohol because of it,"I hate beer and I don't think I will ever like alcohol because of it. Every time I've tried it, it just doesn't appeal to me and I don't see why people enjoy it so much. It's frustrating because it feels like I'm missing out on a social activity that so many others seem to enjoy.",It sounds like you feel left out because you don't enjoy drinking beer as many people around you do. It's important to remember that your tastes and preferences are unique to you. They don't reflect your worth or ability to engage in social situations. Can we explore this further together?,"Yes, that would be helpful. I want to understand why I feel this way and how I can navigate social situations where drinking alcohol seems to be the main activity. It actually causes me a lot of stress and anxiety.","I understand that it's causing you stress and anxiety. Let's consider some other possibilities. For instance, perhaps there are other non-alcoholic beverages you could enjoy at these social events? Or maybe you could find an enjoyment in the social aspects of these situations, such as engaging in conversation, rather than focusing on the drinking part? It's also possible to attend and enjoy social activities that don't revolve around drinking. Do you think these could be valid options for you?","Yes, I think those are valid options. I realize I've been focusing so much on the alcohol aspect and not the social interactions that are actually the main purpose of these gatherings. Perhaps I could try to shift my focus and find enjoyment in those. As for non-alcoholic drinks, I might be responsible for arranging my own alternatives so I can feel more included in those toast moments. Thank you for opening up these perspectives.","That's a wonderful insight! It's admirable that you're open to reframing your perspective on this issue. Focusing on the social interactions and making your own arrangements for non-alcoholic alternatives can be a fantastic approach. Remember, it's not the alcohol that defines the enjoyment in these situations, but the company and interactions you have with others. It's okay to be different, your preferences are just as valid. Keep exploring these new angles and you'll find how you can turn this into a positive experience.",
782,Personalization,"I enjoy running, I will probably end up with knee injuries and not be able to run anymore.","I enjoy running, but I have this nagging worry that I might end up injuring my knees and not be able to run anymore.","It sounds like you really love running and it brings you joy. But the fear of potential injury seems to be troubling you. Let's see if we can address this worry: You are currently running and enjoying it, and on the other hand, you have concerns about possible future injuries. These are two distinct aspects; one is your current reality and the other is a hypothetical scenario. Let's focus on what's happening now.","You're right, doctor. I do love running but I've started feeling anxious every time I think about it because of this fear. I understand that I should be focussing on the present but it's hard to ignore the 'what-ifs'.","I can see how the 'what-ifs' can be stressful. Now let's try thinking about this from a different angle: What if you stay healthy and continue running without any injury? Or what if running actually strengthens your knees over time and improves your overall health? What if, even you get injured, you get the opportunity to try a new type of exercise that you may end up enjoying as much as running? Could you consider these possibilities?","Yes, I see your point about shifting my focus to more positive 'what-ifs'. Thinking on those lines definitely gives a more hopeful and less dismal perspective. But what if despite all precautions I still end up hurting myself? I know injuries are part and parcel of an active lifestyle but the fear of not being able to do something I love so much feels crippling.","I understand your concerns and I'm glad you're open to considering positive possibilities. Despite all our precautions, uncertainties do exist in life. However, focusing excessively on potential negatives can limit our ability to enjoy the present. Remember, our bodies are resilient, and even if you do experience an injury, it doesn’t necessarily mean an end to your active lifestyle. In such circumstances, there is always the opportunity to adapt, heal and discover new passions. Let's focus on the joy running brings you now and optimizing your health to minimize injury risk, rather than letting an uncertain future curb your present happiness and activities.",

You're a student working in a hospital; that's a fact. But the assumption that patients will think less of you because you're a student is projecting a negative belief. It's not a certainty. Would you agree?","Yes, I suppose you're right. I think I've been second-guessing myself too much. My being a student doesn't necessarily influence what patients think of me.","That's a good step forward. Let's explore some other possible scenarios under the same circumstances. Could it be that some patients might actually appreciate that a student is taking care of them? They might think you are eager to learn, up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge, or more attentive because you are still learning. What are some other possibilities that you can think of?","Well, I guess some patients might appreciate my fresh perspective and approach. They could see my status as a student as a sign that I'm striving to better myself and my skills. They might even admire my dedication to pursuing my education while working. That makes me think... maybe I shouldn't be so quick to assume the worst.","I'm really impressed by your thoughtful reflection. It shows your empathetic nature and commitment towards your growth, which are admirable traits and certainly not lost on your patients. Remember, your dedication and vigorous quest for knowledge are signs of your potential and enthusiasm, which can undoubtedly inspire trust and respect in your patients.

I'm the worst driver of all time.,It sounds like you're feeling really down for being late to the dinner. Let's try to separate the situation from the thought: you were late - that's the situation. The thought following is you believing you're the worst driver. Would you consider other factors that may have contributed to you being late?,"Yes, I guess there were some factors beyond my control. The traffic was particularly heavy that day, and there were a few road work sites that I had to detour around. I suppose those were significant factors as well.","That's a great start! Yes, heavy traffic and unexpected detours can definitely play a huge part in causing delays. Can you think of any ways those factors could affect the timing, regardless of who's driving? Could it be possible that anyone in your situation would also arrive late?","Yes, I suppose that's true. Regardless of how good someone is at driving, these outside factors would probably have made anyone late. I was trying my best to get there on time, but these things were beyond my control. I guess I shouldn't be so hard on myself about it.","That's a very perceptive realization. Remember, even the best drivers can't control traffic or unexpected detours. It's crucial to distinguish between factors within your control and those outside of it. You were doing your best, and that's what truly counts. It's okay to be late sometimes, especially when unpredictable factors come into play. Being self-compassionate can greatly benefit your self-esteem and mood.",

The thought is that your entire night is ruined. But are those two things directly connected?,"No, I suppose they're not directly connected. I was just looking forward to enjoying my movie with a nice meal and now that can't happen, so I let it ruin my expectations for the rest of my night.","I see where you're coming from. However, the spoiled salad is just one aspect. Let's think about other possibilities. For example, could you make something else or order a meal? Or maybe, you could shift focus to your movie experience itself, rather than the dining. It may turn out that focusing solely on the movie might enhance your enjoyment. What do you think?","You're right. The ruined salad isn't the end of the world. There are certainly other food options I could explore, and maybe ditching the food altogether would let me focus more on the movie. Thanks for helping me see a different perspective.","I'm really glad to hear you say that. It's true that unexpected things can be disappointing at times, but remember, they don't necessarily dictate the outcome of your whole experience. Focus on the movie itself and enjoy the moment. There are endless possibilities to make something ordinary into an extraordinary one just by altering our perspective. It's excellent that you could see things from a different angle. Keep this up; you're doing great!",
786,Mental filtering,I love speaking different languages but I hate talking to people because I'm color bling.,"I love speaking different languages, but I hate talking to people because I'm colorblind.",It seems like you associate being colorblind with negative experiences in speaking to people. Could it be possible that these two are distinct aspects of your life? Let's take a moment to consider them separately.,You're right. I guess I've just pasted these two aspects together in my mind. My color blindness shouldn't necessarily impact my ability to communicate with people. I love languages after all.,"That's a great realization! Now, let's explore more. Can you think of any potential opportunities or positive aspects that may arise from being colorblind and having a passion for languages? For example, how might these two traits uniquely influence your communication or approach to learning languages?","Well, being colorblind might help me focus more on the language itself rather than getting distracted by visual aspects. It also teaches me to pay more attention to other senses, which could play a role in understanding and learning new languages. And there can be some unique experiences behind overcoming the colorblind challenge in communicating with people. Instead of seeing it as a barrier, I guess I can consider it as a different perspective I can bring into a conversation while talking to people. That could be a conversation starter and could help to deepen my relationships with people. It's also a great opportunity for me to raise awareness about color blindness.","That's a wonderful perspective you've developed! Your unique experiences with color blindness can indeed enhance your communication and deepen your understanding of languages. It's inspiring to see how you have turned a challenge into an opportunity for growth, not just for yourself but also in raising awareness for others. Keep leveraging this unique perspective, it may open up new and exciting paths for you. Remember, your perspective has the power to convert obstacles into opportunities.",
787,Should statements,"My calves look a little small, but it's strange because I should look like a professional athlete given the fact that I work out a few times each week.","I've been feeling a bit self-conscious about my calves lately. It's odd because I've been consistently working out and putting effort into building muscle, but they still appear smaller than I would like them to be. It's making me question if there's something wrong or if I'm doing something wrong with my fitness routine.","It sounds like you've been dedicating a lot of time and effort towards building muscle and improving your physical fitness, but you're feeling disappointed about the slow progress with your calves, is that right? You're questioning whether this may be due to a mistake in your fitness routine. Can you try to think of this situation from a different perspective?","Well, maybe my expectations are unrealistic or too high given the time I have put in so far. Not everyone can have a physique like a professional athlete, especially not in such a short amount of time. Perhaps, my muscles are growing but at a slower pace and in a way that I don't recognize. I might also be comparing myself to the wrong standards. I also should remember that working out is not just about appearance, but also about health, strength, and general well-being.","Those are very insightful thoughts! It's true, we often compare ourselves to unrealistic images and standards which can create unnecessary stress and disappointment. What you said about muscles growing at different paces and in different ways is also very important. Maybe your calves are strengthening and toning up in a way that isn't as visibly noticeable to you? And also fitness is indeed about more than just looks - it's primarily about strength, health, and overall well-being. Let's continue to explore these possibilities - can you think of any other situations where you felt similar dissatisfaction but it turned out that your perspective was what needed adjusting?","Well, yes, I have felt similarly about my academic performance before. There were times when I studied a lot, but my grades were not as high as I expected them to be. I compared myself to top students and felt inadequate. Later on, I realized that everyone has their own pace of learning and everyone's approach to studying is different. It wasn't that I was studying incorrectly, but rather that I had set unrealistic expectations for myself and compared myself to the best performers without taking into consideration that they might be studying even more than I was, or they might have been familiar with the material due to previous experience. Over time, I saw improvement in my academic performance as I started focusing on my own progress rather than comparing it with others.","Absolutely, it's extremely essential to recognize that everyone has their own unique journey, whether it be in physical fitness or academics. What you've realized about your academic performance is equally applicable to your fitness routine. It may take time to see the progress you desire considering everyone's body responds to exercise differently. Keep focusing on your personal growth and remember that your journey should be about feeling stronger, healthier, and happier. The comparison should only be with your past self, not others. The fact that you are putting in consistent effort and dedication toward your goal is commendable in itself. Keep progressing at your own pace.",
788,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,I live with a roommate who will probably destroy the apartment next time he throws a party.,I live with a roommate who will probably destroy the apartment next time he throws a party. I'm really worried about what might happen and how it will affect our living situation.,I see that you're feeling stressed about your roommate's behavior. Let's take a step back for a moment. The situation is: your roommate occasionally throws parties. What you're thinking is: he will probably destroy the apartment at his next party. It's important to separate the actual events from your worries about possible outcomes.,You're right. It is just a worry about a potential outcome. The truth is he hasn't really destroyed the apartment yet. But his parties are quite wild and it's causing me a lot of stress just thinking of the possible damage in the future.,"It's great that you're recognizing this as a worry rather than a guarantee. Now, let's consider other possibilities that could happen at his parties. Yes, things can get wild, but does that necessarily have to result in damage? Maybe the guests are respectful of your space despite the wild atmosphere. Maybe your roommate cleans up and fixes anything minor after each party. Let's think about these and other possible scenarios as well.","You're right, there could be other possible scenarios. I just focused on the worst one. The guests at the party are usually our mutual friends and they do respect our house. And my roommate does make the effort to tidy up after the parties. I guess I've been overly worried about things that haven't happened yet.","Absolutely, it's easy to imagine the worst-case scenarios. Acknowledging those fears is okay, but it's equally important to consider more positive outcomes too. You've identified possibilities that are more likely, like your friends respecting your house and your roommate cleaning up after the party. Reframing our thoughts can help reduce stress around uncertain situations. Remember, your concerns are valid, but so are these other, less anxious possibilities. Stressing over something that hasn't happened can rob you of your peace. It's always better to maintain open communication with your roommate about your concerns. Trust in his responsibility as a roommate as well.",
789,Should statements,After researching religion I don’t believe in God anymore and everyone else should think the same as I do.,"I have been researching religion lately, and as a result, I have come to the realization that I no longer believe in God. In fact, I feel like everyone else should also think the same way as I do.",It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into your personal beliefs which is a positive thing. But how do you feel about distinguishing between your personal journey and others'?,"You're right. It's indeed my personal journey and a conclusion I've arrived at after a considerable amount of research. Maybe, expecting others to think like me may not be appreciative of their personal experiences and beliefs. Each person should be able to explore and come to their own conclusions. I can present my viewpoint without pushing it onto others.","That's a wonderful self-reflection! So, given your newfound perspective about individual beliefs, how else do you imagine you could express your thoughts to others about religion, without expecting them to necessarily adopt your viewpoint, while also maintaining an open, respectful dialogue?","I think I can approach it by politely discussing my findings and beliefs about religion and why they have led me to feel the way I do. But I also need to remind myself and express to others that these are my conclusions based on my own personal journey. I would be open to hearing their viewpoints, offering a space where they feel comfortable to share their beliefs. An exchange of ideas may lead to a better understanding of each other, even if our beliefs differ.","That's a thoughtful approach. Recognising that everyone's journey is personal and respecting their viewpoints is the key to a productive discussion. Your willingness to share your findings without imposing your beliefs and being open to listening to others means you are promoting an environment of understanding and respect. Keep in mind, each discussion is a chance to learn, grow and shape your thoughts, even if the beliefs differ. Keep going with this compassionate and thoughtful approach.",
790,Personalization,My friends are ignoring me because I been a bad friend by avoiding them.,I have been feeling really down lately because I think my friends are ignoring me. It's been difficult for me because I feel like I've been a bad friend by avoiding them.,"I am really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but let's try to separate your thoughts from the situation. What makes you believe that your friends are ignoring you? And why do you think you're a bad friend for avoiding them?","I'm not sure, it just feels like they don't want to hang out with me as much anymore. Every time I suggest something, they always have an excuse. In turn, I start avoiding their calls or messages because it feels like I'm not wanted. It makes me feel like a bad friend because friends should be there for one another and I'm not doing my part.","I understand how their actions could lead you to feel this way. However, it's also possible there could be reasons unrelated to you. For example, they might be going through personal issues or have work-related stress that causes them to decline your hangouts. Have you thought about reaching out to discuss your feelings with each other? Not all friends are able to meet all the time, it doesn't necessarily make you a bad friend. What other possibilities could explain their behaviors?","I guess it could be that they are busier now, or dealing with their own issues. I never considered that. Maybe they are stressed at work or having problems at home. I thought it was all because of me. I guess also, we're still in a pandemic and some of them might be more cautious about socializing. They might have their own feelings of fear or anxiety. I understand these points but it's hard to internalize them. I still feel unwanted at times. Maybe I should talk to them about how I'm feeling. It's difficult because I don't want to make the situation about me when they might be going through their own things.","It's excellent that you're beginning to see different possibilities for your friends' behaviors and considering their own challenges. It's absolutely natural to feel unwanted at times, especially when we feel we're being ignored. However, it's empowering that you're considering the idea of having a conversation about how you feel with your friends. It doesn't mean you're making the situation all about you, rather it's about understanding each other better. Accept that it's okay to express your feelings, because communication is vital to the health and maintenance of the relationship. Everyone has their own struggles, including you. Remember, it takes strength to reach out and discuss your feelings, and doing so often shows that you are a good friend.",
791,Should statements,"I like to play nintendo, everyone should come and enjoy playing nintendo games with me.",I've been feeling really excited about playing Nintendo games lately. I love it so much that I think everyone should come and enjoy playing Nintendo games with me. It's such a great way to have fun and relax.,It's great that you're enjoying Nintendo games. Can you help clarify the situation here? Is it that you're concerned because not everyone shares your interest or informed about the fun of Nintendo games?,"Yes, that seems to be the case. I'm just a bit disappointed when others don't share or see the interest and fun I see in Nintendo games. On top of that, I've been feeling a little isolated lately and I thought this could be a good way for me to connect with others.","I understand why you might feel disappointed and isolated when others don't share your love for Nintendo games. However, could there be other explanations, or ways to look at it? Like maybe others have different ways of having fun or they might not have been introduced to the joy of these games yet. What do you think?","You're right. I think I've been so caught up in my own passion that I've forgotten that people have different interests and ways of having fun. And it's true, maybe they just haven't been introduced to Nintendo games yet, or they haven't found the right game that resonates with them. I shouldn't take it personally and just continue to enjoy my own interests. Thank you for helping me see things from a different perspective.","That's an amazing perspective to have! You're absolutely correct that each person has unique interests. It's crucial not to take it personally if others don't share your passion for Nintendo games. Instead, keep enjoying your hobby and perhaps your enthusiasm might persuade some people to give it a try. At the same time, remember that forming connections with others can also come from shared experiences and interests beyond gaming. Keep exploring and enjoy your journey!",
792,Should statements,I work in a factory and I am not social. My co-workers should never talk to me on the factory floor.,I work in a factory and I am not social. My co-workers should never talk to me on the factory floor. I prefer to keep to myself and focus on my work instead of socializing with others. It feels uncomfortable when my co-workers try to strike up conversation or engage in small talk. I find it distracting and it hinders my ability to concentrate on my tasks.,"It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed when your co-workers try to engage with you on the factory floor as this distracts from your work. Can we identify the reality of your situation separately from your thoughts about it? Could there be another way to look at this?
","Yes, I suppose I could try to view their attempts at conversation as them trying to be friendly or create a better work environment, rather than it being a distraction from my work. They probably don't realise that I find it hard to multitask or that I prefer solitude while working. I guess another way of looking at this could be to see the potential benefits of socializing with my co-workers, like improved work relationships or increased team spirit. It's just that I'm not much of a social person and I find it easier to work in silence.","You've done a great job at considering another viewpoint: that your co-workers are trying to create a more friendly environment which can lead to improved work relationships. Have you considered any other scenarios that may arise from their attempts to talk with you? For instance, do you think it's possible they might value your opinions or that they see it as part of a teamwork effort? Could their 'distractions' also be an opportunity for a short mental break, improving your overall productivity?","That's something I haven't considered. Maybe they do value my opinion and want to include me as part of the team. I guess I never saw it that way because I was focused on it being a disruption to my work. It could give me a short mental break and refresh my mind, which might ultimately enhance my productivity. It's also possible that there could be important information or updates that I might miss out on if I continue to avoid social interactions at work. I will try to take these factors into consideration and maybe try to make a bit more effort when it comes to interacting with my co-workers.","That's a notable shift in perspective and I commend you for your openness to see things differently. With this new viewpoint, it could provide a fresh lens to the situation, leveraging those interactions as opportunities rather than disturbances. Remember, it's alright to acknowledge that you prefer working quietly, but having occasional small talks doesn't interfere with that. It's about finding a balance that works for you. You might discover benefits you hadn't considered before. I encourage you to gently make this shift and observe the changes.",
793,Should statements,"I love to go to the symphony orchestra, but I will miss their next show","I love to go to the symphony orchestra, but I will miss their next show. It's such a disappointment because I really enjoy their performances and the atmosphere at the concert hall.",It sounds like you are feeling disappointed because you will miss the next show. Let's talk a bit more about this. Is it the missing of the show that's disappointing or is it the thought of losing the joy that the show brings for you?,"I think it's a bit of both. I am disappointed because I will miss the show, but more so because I will miss the joy and tranquility the show provides. The symphony is usually a big part of my routine and it feels like something is missing when I don't go.",I can understand that missing the symphony makes you feel like something valuable is missing from your routine. But let's consider other possibilities. Could there be other ways to experience similar feelings of joy and tranquility during that time? Or is there anything new you have wanted to try that could offer a different yet rewarding experience?,"You're right, maybe I could try something else that I've always wanted to do. I've always had an interest in art, maybe I could visit an art museum or try a painting class. This could be a good opportunity to explore that interest more. I might discover a new source of tranquility and joy.","That sounds like a great idea! You're opening yourself up to new experiences and who knows, you could find equal or even more joy in exploring art. Remember, it's not about replacing your love for the symphony but allowing yourself to find pleasure in other spheres as well. It's great that you're turning your disappointment into a chance for discovery and growth. Keep this positive mindset, it will be your guiding star on this journey.",
794,Discounting the positive,"I am a graduate student, I'm too stupid to get a good job.","I am a graduate student, but I constantly feel like I am not intelligent enough to secure a good job. I doubt my abilities and fear that I will not be successful in my career.","I understand your worries, it's clear that you're feeling a lot of pressure about your future. Let's take a moment to differentiate between the situation and your thought. The situation is that you're a graduate student ready to start your career. Your thought, however, is that you're not intelligent enough to get a good job and be successful. Can we agree on that?","Yes, you're right. I am a graduate student ready to start my career, but the thought that I'm not intelligent enough to get a good job and be successful is indeed overwhelming me.","Okay, let's try to see this situation from other perspectives. What if your intelligence isn't the only thing that determines your success in your career? What if your perseverance, grit, and unique perspective are just as critical, if not more? Or, could there be opportunities outside your current career path where your abilities could be appreciated and valued? Try to think about these possibilities.","You have a point there. I hadn't considered the importance of my perseverance, grit, and unique perspective. Maybe my intelligence is not the only determining factor for success in my career. I also hadn't thought about the other opportunities outside of my career path. There could indeed be a place where my abilities could be appreciated and valued. It's an eye-opening perspective.","That's indeed a positive step forward! Remember, everyone has their own unique strengths and the road to success is versatile. Intelligence is just one of many factors that contribute to career success. Embrace your grit, perseverance, and unique perspective because these qualities are just as important. It's also great that you've begun to consider other opportunities where your abilities can be appreciated. Keep exploring these thoughts. Not every path is right for everyone, but there is surely a path that's right for you. Keep believing in yourself.",
795,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I love softball but once the ball hit me so i think im just done playing the sport it only ends in pain.,"I love softball, but I recently had an experience where the ball hit me, and now I feel like I should just give up on the sport because it only brings me pain.","It sounds like you enjoy softball but because you've recently experienced pain from an accident, you're associating the sport with discomfort. Is it possible to separate the incident from the game itself? Keep a moment to think about it.",You're right. Maybe I'm just letting this one painful incident cloud my overall experience and enjoyment of the game. I'll need to really think about this.,"That's a great start. Now think about this, if the incident hadn't happened, how would you feel about softball? Could the accident be a learning experience to better your skills or take additional precautions? What possibilities could exist if you reframed this incident not as a dreadful experience, but as an opportunity in disguise?","I suppose if I separate the incident from my overall experience, then I would still have my love for the sport. The accident could be a learning point for me, maybe it highlights that I need further training or that I should always keep my guard up when playing. This could actually help me become a better player. So, turning this incident into a learning opportunity seems like a more positive way to frame it. Thank you for your insights.","I'm so glad to hear you thinking about the incident in this new light. It's always tough when things we love bring us discomfort, but you've done great work separating the incident from the sport. Remember, setbacks often offer crucial opportunities for growth. You've shown immense strength and positivity in acknowledging this. Let this resilience guide you as you continue your journey with softball, becoming a more experienced player. I'm behind you all the way. You've got this!",
796,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I am almost finished with my degree but i  will be broke and never get to pay to finish my college.,"I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately because I am almost finished with my degree, but I don't have enough money to pay for the remaining semesters. It makes me worry that I will never be able to finish college.","First off, it's completely normal to worry about finances - it's a common concern many of us deal with. But, it's important to take a step back and assess the situation. On one hand, you're about to finish your degree—a big accomplishment—and on the other hand, there's the financial challenge. Note that the two issues are separate: your achievement is not defined by your current financial strain. You're confusing your financial situation with your ability to succeed, which isn't accurate.","You're right, I've been equating my financial situation with my ability to finish my degree. However, I now see that these are two separate issues. Even though I may be struggling financially, it doesn't mean I can't find a way to finish my degree. I should focus on my achievements, rather than my current financial struggles.","That's a great perspective! Now, let's consider some other possibilities despite the financial obstacles. What are some alternatives you could explore? Have you looked into scholarships or grants? Or perhaps a part-time job or internship? There is always the option of speaking to your school's financial aid office to discuss possible payment plans. There are many paths to achieving the same goal. The key is to remain open to all possibilities.","I haven't really looked into scholarships or grants, I just assumed I wouldn't qualify. But, you're right, I should at least try. A part-time job could also help me manage my finances better while I finish my degree. I've been avoiding contacting the financial aid office, there might be some options I can explore there, too. I think I've missed out on some possible solutions by not considering all my options. Thank you for helping me realize this. I feel a bit less overwhelmed now.","I'm glad to hear you're feeling less overwhelmed; that's a step in the right direction. It's wonderful that you're examining alternative options such as scholarships, grants, a part-time job, and discussing possibilities with the financial aid office. These are proactive measures that can have a huge impact on your situation, and should incite some positive change. Don't discount your ability to find solutions because as you've just shown, you have the creativity and resilience to explore multiple paths to reach your goal. The road to your degree isn't just one narrow path, there are many ways to get there. Keep up this optimistic and solution-oriented mindset!",
797,Discounting the positive,"People say that I am in a happy marriage, but so does many other people.","I've been thinking lately about how people say that I'm in a happy marriage, but so do many other people. It's been bothering me because I'm starting to wonder if I'm truly happy or if I'm just trying to convince myself that I am because it's what society expects.","It sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort with your perception of your marriage's happiness. Let's start by separating the situation and your thoughts about it. The situation is that you're married, and others believe it's a happy one. Now, your thoughts about this situation are that you may be convincing yourself of being happy due to societal expectations. Am I correct so far?","Yes, you're correct. I'm starting to feel like maybe I've been lying to myself about my happiness in my marriage because it's what people expect me to say or feel. I just don't know if what I'm feeling is real happiness or just me trying to fit in.","I appreciate your honesty and vulnerability in sharing this. It could be that what you feel is a more complex form of happiness that doesn't fit the stereotype, which can make it seem as though you're not truly happy. However, there are also many other possibilities. For example, could it be that maybe you're just going through a temporary phase of uncertainty? Or perhaps your definition of happiness is evolving, and you're just adjusting to this new understanding? Could it even be possible that societal expectations are making you critical of genuine feelings of contentment in your marriage? Let's explore these options and any others you can think of.","Those are possibilities that I haven't fully considered before. Maybe I am going through a temporary phase of uncertainty. Life has been a little more stressful than usual lately, which could be influencing my feelings of uncertainty. I guess I'm not totally sure what my definition of happiness is, especially within my marriage. And it's definitely possible that societal expectations are influencing how I perceive my own emotions and feelings. I just don't know how to sort through all these potential factors.","It's fantastic that you're opening up and considering these possibilities. It's beneficial to delve into one's own feelings and societal influences. Remember, it's completely okay to be unsure at times, especially with something as complex as personal happiness. Facebook and other social platforms often portray a picture of constant joy in relationships, which may not reflect reality, and definitely should not be a yardstick for measuring your own joy. I suggest we navigate through these thoughts and uncertainties together, with the end goal of finding out what truly makes you happy in your marriage, independent of external influences and societal expectations. This way, we can discover what your unique version of a 'happy marriage' means to you.",
798,Discounting the positive,"I made a lot of money in the stock market, but I didn't do anything great. Luck, I'm sure.","I made a lot of money in the stock market, but I didn't do anything great. It feels like it was all just luck.","It's good to hear about your success in the stock market. However, I noticed your thought is attributing the success solely to luck. Could we explore this a bit more? Are ""making money in the stock market"" and ""not achieving anything great"" completely aligned?","Well, when you say it like that, I guess they're not completely aligned. It does take some level of skill and strategy to succeed in the stock market. But I always thought ""achieving something great"" meant doing something that had a significant impact or value to others, not just accumulating wealth by trading stocks.","That's a very interesting perspective. Now, given your success in the stock market, what might be some possibilities where your skills and strategy could be used to create significant impact or value to others? Could there be ways where this scenario could be seen in a different light?","Hmm, you're right. Maybe I could use my know-how and profits to contribute to society. I could invest my earnings into businesses or projects that have social impact. Or perhaps, I can volunteer or even start classes teaching others about understanding the stock market. Thank you, I guess I've never really thought about it this way.","I'm glad to see you opening up to those ideas. Realizing that your success in the stock market can indeed be used for the greater good is something I see as an achievement. Your insights on investing in socially impactful businesses or sharing your knowledge with others could significantly help many people. Remember, the impact and value you bring to others isn't just about what you do, but also the potential your skills and resources can unleash for the benefit of others. Keep exploring these beautiful possibilities and use your success for the greater good. You have it within you to make a meaningful difference.",
799,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,My kitten bite me. I hate animals.,I was feeling really upset and frustrated because my kitten bit me. It made me really angry and I started to hate animals.,"I see, so your kitten biting you led to feelings of frustration and anger, so much so that it's causing you to develop negative feelings towards all animals. But would you agree that the situation (being bitten by your kitten) and the thought (hating all animals) might be connected but not necessarily have to be the same thing?","Yes, I suppose you're right. It was just one incident, and I shouldn't let it dictate how I feel about all animals. It's probably my anger talking, not my true feelings.",That's a great realization. Now let's consider some other possibilities. The kitten might have bitten you as part of their playing or because it's scared or anxious. This behavior doesn't necessarily represent all animals. Or could there perhaps be another reason why you reacted so strongly to this situation? Could it be that you were already upset or frustrated about something else and the kitten's behavior felt like 'the last straw'?,"Yes, it's true. I had a really stressful day at work. The kitten biting me was just the end of a very frustrating day. It wasn't the kitten that made me angry at all animals, it was the stress that made me snap. I should not have generalized my anger towards all animals. That wasn't fair.","I understand why you felt that way and I think it's really insightful of you to realize the true source of your frustration. It's completely normal to react the way you did after a stressful day. Remember, it's okay to have moments of frustration but try not to let it cloud your judgement towards others, animals included. Emotions can sometimes lead us to exaggerate situations. Animals, like people, have their own behaviors and it’s not always a reflection of their nature or personality. You've made a big step today in understanding your emotions and I encourage you to continue reframing such situations in future.",
800,Overgeneralization,I got an ergonomic chair but now my back hurts more than before. I am so unhealthy that I'm falling apart.,"I feel frustrated because I recently bought an ergonomic chair to help with my back pain, but instead, it seems to be making it worse. I can't help but feel like my overall health is deteriorating, and it's making me think that I am just falling apart.","I can understand why you are frustrated. Now, let's separate the situation from your thoughts. The situation is that your new ergonomic chair doesn't seem to relieve your back pain like you thought it would. The related thought that comes up is that you are feeling as though your overall health is deteriorating. Is this correct?","Yes, that's correct. The chair was supposed to help, but my back pain seems to be getting worse. This makes me feel like my health is just falling apart.","I see, it’s saddening when things don't work out as we expect. But let's consider all possible possibilities. Could it be that your body just needs more time to adjust to the new chair? Or perhaps, the chair's settings are not adjusted correctly? It could also be that there are other factors contributing to your back pain. Would you be open to exploring these potential reasons?","Yes, I think I would be open to that. Now that you point it out, it might be true that my body requires more time to adjust to the chair. And maybe I need to check if it's adjusted correctly. It just felt easier to me to instantly link the increased pain to the chair and my health.","That's a great perspective, and I'm glad you're open to exploring these possibilities! It's quite normal to link events and feelings together, especially when it comes to our health. But remember, change often requires adjustment, as does the body to a new setting. It takes time, patience and a bit of exploration to figure things out. Let's take the time needed to understand this better, and I'm sure we will find a way to alleviate your discomfort. You're doing really well, and I believe in your ability to manage this.",
801,Labeling and mislabeling,I'm such a nerd because I love comic books and my hero is Superman.,"I often feel like a nerd because I have a great love for comic books, and my ultimate hero is Superman.",It seems like you're feeling judged because of your passion for comic books and admiration for Superman. But let's separate the situation from the thought. You enjoy comic books and you admire Superman. How do these facts lead you to think you're a nerd?,"Well, I've often heard that being deeply into things like comic books and superheroes is something only ""nerds"" do. And since I enjoy those things greatly, I guess I started self-labeling as a nerd. Society often considers 'nerds' as being different, and that makes me feel like I don't fit in.","I see where you're coming from and how societal labels can affect one's self-perception. However, let's consider alternate perspectives. Could it also be possible that your interest in comics and superheroes reflects your love for art, storytelling, and perhaps even your ability to believe in something greater? Many people admire these qualities. How do you feel about exploring this different narrative?","I never really thought about it that way. Yes, I do love the storytelling aspect of comic books and the artistry that goes into creating them. And I guess my fascination with superheroes does reflect my belief in courage, justice, and the greater good. Seeing it in this light makes me feel less judged and more understood. It also makes my interest feel more meaningful than just a 'nerdy' hobby.","That's a wonderful realization! Your interest in comic books and superheroes is a testament to your appreciation for art, storytelling, and the values of courage and justice. It is these unique interests that make us who we are. There's no need to label yourself negatively because of them. Embrace your passions, they make you unique and interesting. You do belong, not because you are like everyone else, but because you are comfortable in your own skin, appreciating the things you love.",
802,Catastrophizing,"I drink coffee everyday, I know that my heart is going to explode.",I often find myself thinking that drinking coffee every day is going to make my heart explode.,"It sounds like you're concerned about your coffee habits and potential health effects, particularly on your heart. Let's try to look at the situation differently. First off, is drinking coffee something you need to do daily? And second, the thought of it causing extreme harm, like your heart exploding, is that based on certain facts or just uncertain worry?","Yes, it's become a daily habit for me to drink coffee. And about my heart exploding, I know it sounds irrational but it's more of an exaggerated worry caused by slight palpitations that I feel sometimes. It's just that heart diseases are common in my family and I'm really scared that my caffeine consumption might trigger something.","That's understandable given your family history. It's natural to worry about health especially when there are certain factors at play. However, let's consider other possibilities. Even with palpitations, it is not necessarily indicative of dire health. Various factors like stress or anxiety can also cause such feelings. As for your coffee consumption, while it's a habit, there may be ways to adjust it without completely removing it. Perhaps using less caffeine or exploring decaf alternatives may still give you the comfort of the habit but lessen your worry. Let's explore this together. Do you think there may be other habits or changes you could introduce to also help manage your worry?","Yes, I think reducing my caffeine intake and trying decaf might be a good start. I've also heard that physical activities and a balanced diet can help maintain heart health, so maybe I can include regular exercise and a healthier diet in my routine. As for stress management, I think taking up yoga or mindfulness exercises might help. It seems that I've been overly focused on the potential dangers of coffee, and overlooked other lifestyle changes that I can make for my heart health.","That's an excellent approach you have thought of. Reducing the caffeine, trying decaf, physical exercise, a balanced diet, and managing stress through yoga and mindfulness - each one of these has potential benefits for heart health. It's good to see you looking at a more comprehensive solution rather than focusing solely on the coffee. Remember, it's about moderation, not necessarily elimination. These lifestyle changes are a really positive step towards your overall wellbeing. Keep in mind, it's okay to enjoy your coffee while also taking care of your heart health. You're taking control of your situation, which is really commendable.",
803,Mental filtering,"I love to write and I am going to school for it.However, the other day I had writer's block so that soured everything.","I love writing and it has always been my passion. It's something I've been pursuing and even decided to go to school for it. But recently, I experienced writer's block and it has been really disheartening. It's like everything I used to enjoy about writing has lost its spark. I feel stuck and it's frustrating.","I understand that you're feeling stuck and frustrated due to your recent writer's block. So let's try to separate the situation from your thought. The situation is that currently, you're experiencing writer's block. The thoughts are that everything you used to enjoy about writing has lost its spark. Correct?","Yes, that's correct. I'm having trouble distinguishing the situation from my thoughts. It feels like this writer's block is overshadowing everything else and it is pushing me to question my passion for writing.","I see how writer's block can feel overwhelming. Now, let's consider some other possibilities. Could this block possibly be an opportunity to rediscover your passion, maybe by exploring new writing styles or genres? Could it be that your mind needs rest and perhaps engaging in other interests could help spark creativity? It's common for many artists to go through such phases; could this just be temporary and part of your creative journey?","I never thought about it that way. I suppose it could be an opportunity to venture into different styles. And perhaps you're right, maybe I do need some rest outside of writing to recharge my creativity. Maybe it is just a phase of my creative journey that will pass eventually. It's hard to see past my frustration and disappointment right now though.","I really appreciate your openness and willingness to consider these new perspectives. It's absolutely okay to feel frustrated and disappointed. These emotions are valid and it's completely natural to feel this way when faced with challenges. However, the idea you've shared, about exploring different styles of writing and the need for some rest, really resonates with reality. Remember, every writer, experienced or not, goes through phases like these. It's part of the journey and it's what fuels growth. It's definitely challenging now, but this phase doesn't define your passion or capability for writing. Hang in there and give yourself permission to explore, rest and grow.",
804,Labeling and mislabeling,"I am a soccer player, but always sit the bench because I am so useless.","I am a soccer player, but I always find myself sitting on the bench. It makes me feel useless and like I don't contribute anything to the team.","I understand you're feeling less useful because you're not playing as often. However, let's consider the position you're in separately. You're on a soccer team, but you're not being played frequently. That's your situation. Now, your interpretation of not being put in the game is making you feel useless and non-contributory. That is your thought. Remember, your situation doesn't define you or your worth.","I see your point. I guess I'm taking the situation very personally and letting it define my self-worth. But it's hard not to feel unwanted and less than important when I'm not given the chance to play. So, how can I shift this negative perspective into something more positive?","That's a great question! Let's think about some other ways you might interpret this situation. For instance, you could view it as an opportunity to learn. Maybe the coach is trying to see how you handle adversity? Perhaps it's a chance to work on your skills, improve your game and become a better player. It could also mean the team relies on you in different ways other than being on the field. Can you think of any other ways to view this situation?","Yes, you're right. Maybe I can use this chance to observe my teammates' skills on the field and learn from them. It could be an opportunity to learn patience and resilience. I guess I could also use the extra time to hit the gym and work on my fitness and agility, which will probably serve me well when I get to play. Maybe being on the bench isn't that bad after all. I just need to change the way I look at it.","That's an excellent perspective you've just shared. It's evident that you're beginning to see your situation in a new light. You're not just a benchwarmer; you're a learner, a keen observer, and someone patient enough to wait for the right opportunity to unleash their potential. This mindset will strengthen not only your soccer performance but also your resilience in facing any life challenges. Hang in there, continue viewing things from a positive angle and keep working towards your goals. Remember, your value and contribution to the team aren't defined by the time spent on the field but by your attitude and effort.",
805,Labeling and mislabeling,My weight is too much. I am such irresponsible person,I feel like my weight is too much and I can't help but blame myself for it. I feel like such an irresponsible person because I haven't been able to take control of my weight.,"I understand that you're feeling upset about your weight. Let's break things down a bit. There's the fact of your current weight, and then there's the thought that associates your current weight with you being irresponsible. We need to look at these as two standalone issues.","Yes, you are right. I think I am blending two different issues together. I'm struggling with my weight and I have been very harsh on myself, labeling myself as irresponsible.","That's a huge step you've just taken. Now, let's consider some alternative ways of viewing your situation. Can you think of any other reasons, beyond irresponsibility, that might contribute to your current weight? For instance, could it be related with your busy schedule, stress level, or physical health? Or could it be due to lack of proper information about nutrition or exercise? Try to consider various alternative causes.","Yes, I guess there are other factors at play here that I hadn't fully considered. My work schedule is extremely busy and stressful, which often leads me to make unhealthy food choices as a quick fix. I also don't have a lot of time to devote to exercise or cooking healthier meals. I suppose if I had more information about nutrition and ways to incorporate exercise into a busy routine, I might be in a better position to manage my weight more effectively.","That's an incredible insight and it shows your willingness to look at the situation from a different perspective. It's not about you being irresponsible, but about how your current circumstances affect your choices. Each one of us struggles, especially when balancing a busy schedule with healthy choices. Remember, it's important to be as compassionate to ourselves as we would be to others. Having recognized that stress and lack of time contribute to your current situation, maybe you could consider seeking out resources to make healthier choices within the constraints of your schedule. This is already a big step towards reclaiming control over your health. You've got this!",
806,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,"I recently proposed to my girlfriend, if she says no I'm going to end it all.","I recently proposed to my girlfriend, and I've been feeling really overwhelmed and anxious about her response. If she says no, I don't know if I can handle it. It feels like my whole world is on the line. It's been consuming my thoughts and it's been difficult to focus on anything else.","I can see that you're letting this proposal weigh on your emotions quite heavily. Let's try to break down your situation. One thing is the proposal and your girlfriend's response, while the other is your emotional reaction to it. It's natural to feel nervous about such a big step. Let's try to understand your thoughts and feelings better.","Alright, I understand. I suppose I've been looking at this situation in a very one-sided way. That her response might dictate my future entirely. I realize that my reaction to it is potentially more damaging than her possible rejection. I need to address this emotional turbulence I'm going through. It's not just about her response, it's about how I'm dealing with it.","That's a significant realization. Now, let us explore alternate perspectives. Your girlfriend's response could be one of many possibilities - she could say no, yes or that she needs more time to decide. Each possibility will lead to a different scenario. But, how about focusing on your own emotional well-being in each scenario? Would it change anything and what would those changes look like? Remember, it's not only about the scenario, it's how you're going to emotionally navigate through each one. Similarly, can you think of other possibilities under this situation?","You're right. I've been focusing way too much on exactly what she's going to say and not enough attention on what I can control, which is my response to it. If she says no, of course, I'll be disappointed, but it's not the end of the world. I can take it as an opportunity to grow and learn. If it's a yes, it's great and yet again, something I'd have to navigate responsibly. If she needs time, I should be mature and patient to give her that. 

I do realize that this isn't just about the proposal or her response, it's more about me managing myself. There are additional possibilities as well, for example, we can have a mutually open conversation about our future, expressing both our fears and hopes. This could give us, both perspective, and reduce a lot of my anxiety. Contemplating the scenarios like this makes me feel a bit relieved. I've been making it bigger in my head than it really is. Now, I just need to focus on being emotionally strong whatever the outcome.","I'm really impressed with your ability to see the situation from different angles. You've come to understand that there are multiple possibilities and your feelings about them are within your control. It's a big step and it's okay to feel anxious, but remember, no matter her answer, you have the capacity to handle it. By opening up a mature discussion about your future or handling her decision gracefully, you're showing emotional strength. Hang onto that perspective. That's growth and it extends beyond just this situation. It applies to all areas of life.",
807,Labeling and mislabeling,"I like watching surgery videos, that makes me a psychopath.",I have this thought that liking to watch surgery videos makes me a psychopath. It's been bothering me and I'm not sure what to make of it.,"Okay, let's break this down. On the one hand, you have this interest in watching surgical videos. On the other, you have a fear that this interest makes you a psychopath. Is that correct?","Yes, that's right. I'm afraid that my interest in such videos could be a sign of something wrong with me, like being a psychopath.","Alright, I totally understand where you're coming from. However, could there be other reasons why you like watching these videos? For instance, you might have a fascination with medical processes, or you might be interested in the science and complexity of surgeries. Could any of these be the case?","Yes, now that you mention it, I do have a fascination with the science behind surgeries and medical procedures. It's not so much about the gore or blood, but understanding how they're able to fix issues within the human body really intrigues me. But, I've been worried that my interest in such a unique aspect could be interpreted the wrong way.","Thank you for sharing that insight! There it is, you have a genuine curiosity for surgery and the medical field, which could be a passion many admire and you shouldn't fear it. Every interest is unique, not necessarily abnormal. This curiosity indicates your ability to appreciate complex processes, not an inclination towards any harmful characteristics. Remember, your interests and thoughts don't label you immediately. Continue to embrace your curiosity and never hesitate to explore your interests.",
808,Overgeneralization,I don't like vegetables.  Unfortunately this cuts out a huge variety of dishes so my meals will never be interesting.,I don't like vegetables. This makes it difficult because I feel like it limits my options for meals and makes them less exciting.,"I hear you, not liking vegetables can indeed seem limiting for meal options. Can we take a moment to consider the situation differently - you not liking vegetables, and your thoughts of it making meals less exciting are two separate things. Let's try to explore that.","Absolutely, I'm open to discussing this further. I guess my dislike for vegetables and my assumption of meals being less interesting because of this could possibly be different issues.","That's a great realization! Now, can you envision any other possibilities using the same situation - not liking vegetables but still having exciting meals? What other foods can you introduce into your meals that you like and might find nutritious and satisfying? What if not liking vegetables now doesn't necessarily mean you won't enjoy them in the future if prepared differently?","You're right, I haven't thought about it that way before. There are other foods that I enjoy such as fruits, grains, dairy, and proteins which can make my meals exciting and nutritious. Additionally, you make a good point that maybe my dislike for vegetables is more due to how they're prepared rather than the vegetables themselves. I can certainly try them prepared in different ways or mixed with other foods that I do enjoy. It's a new perspective and I will definitely consider it.","I'm really proud of you for being open to these new perspectives! You've thought of brilliant alternatives - incorporating other nutritious foods you enjoy, and exploring different ways to prepare vegetables. This is a major step towards overcoming the hurdle. Keep this open-mindedness as you experiment with your meals. It might make the process not just bearable, but exciting too!",
809,Overgeneralization,The chicken nuggets at the restaurant were not great today. Everything there will be terrible now.,I'm feeling disappointed with the chicken nuggets at the restaurant. It makes me believe that everything else there will be terrible now.,"It sounds like you're feeling really let down by the quality of the chicken nuggets you had at that restaurant. This particular experience has made you feel negative about their whole menu, correct?","Yes, exactly. I can't help but think that if their chicken nuggets are that bad, everything else would be terrible too.",I can understand why you'd feel that way. But could it be a possibility that maybe this was an off day for the restaurant? Or perhaps they excel more in other dishes rather than chicken nuggets? It's not uncommon for restaurants to have certain dishes that are praised more than others.,"That could be true, but I'm still not sure if I'm willing to risk it. The disappointment has affected my opinion about the restaurant. But I see your point. Maybe they had an off day or chicken nuggets aren't their specialty.","It's completely understandable that your experience with the chicken nuggets left a bitter taste, both literally and metaphorically. But it's great to see that you're considering other possibilities - after all, the measure of a restaurant is more than just one dish. If you ever decide to give the restaurant another chance, they might surprise you with something you’ll absolutely love. Remember, one bad experience doesn't always define the whole.",
810,Should statements,A woman walked by me and brushed my shoulder. People should leave well enough alone.,I felt really annoyed and irritated when that woman brushed past me and touched my shoulder. I just wish people would mind their own business and leave me alone.,"It sounds like you're feeling quite upset about this encounter. Can we break it down a bit? The situation is that a woman brushed past you and touched your shoulder. Now, let's look at your thoughts about it. You seem to feel that she invaded your personal space and it annoyed you. Is that accurate?","Yes, that's correct. I don't like when my personal space is invaded, it makes me feel uncomfortable and angry. I wish everyone could just understand that and respect it.","I understand how this situation made you feel. Now, let's try to think about other possibilities in this same scenario. Could there be a chance that the woman didn't mean to invade your space and it was unintentional? Maybe she was in a rush or didn't notice the proximity. Could any other possibilities exist in this situation?","Well, I suppose she could have been in a hurry or maybe she didn't realize she brushed against me. I didn't consider these possibilities before but now that you mention it, I guess they're plausible too. But it still bothered me.","I really appreciate that you're willing to consider other possibilities in that situation. It's completely valid to feel upset when you feel your personal space has been invaded, but recognizing that sometimes people may not realize they've done so can help us not to take it personally. Let's keep working on this, using these alternative perspectives could help to lessen the anger and irritation you feel in similar future scenarios.",
811,Should statements,"I love to go hiking, everyone should want to do the same.","I love to go hiking, everyone should want to do the same. It's such a great activity that brings me so much joy and a sense of peace and accomplishment. I just can't understand why others don't seem to share the same enthusiasm for it. It feels like I'm missing out on something or that I'm somehow different from others.",It sounds like you have a great passion for hiking and it brings you a lot of joy. But it's puzzling for you when others don't share this same enthusiasm. It's important to remember that everyone has different interests and preferences. Let's try to separate the love you have for hiking from the expectations you have from others. Would that be okay?,"Yes, I think that would be helpful. I enjoy hiking so much that I just automatically assume everyone should too. It's not fair to expect others to have the same passions as I do. It's just hard for me to understand sometimes. But you are right, I need to separate my interests from my expectations of others.","That's a good start. You've realized that it's not reasonable to expect others to share your loves. Now, let's consider other possibilities. Could it be that others might find joy in activities different than hiking and have just as much passion about those? Or maybe they have reasons that restrict them from hiking, like health conditions or personal circumstances? It's also possible that they simply haven't experienced the joy of hiking yet and might love it if they tried. What do you think?","You're definitely making sense. It would be unfair for me to just assume that hiking is the only activity that can bring joy. People may have other hobbies or passions where they find fulfillment, just like I find in hiking. It's also possible that for reasons unknown to me, they are restricted from such activities. I suppose it's a self-centered point of view to assume that everyone should enjoy the things I do, there's a whole world of diversity out there. This perspective is making me feel more accepting and understanding towards others and their preferences.","It's wonderful to hear you expressing empathy and understanding for others. You've made a significant realization today, that every individual has their own passions and obstacles, just as you have your love for hiking. Everyone's journey is different, and that's what makes life so diverse and unique. Embrace this understanding, and let it encourage you to remain passionate about your interests while respecting and appreciating the diversity in others. You're on the right path!",
812,Labeling and mislabeling,I've been to canada twice in my life but i should go more because i have family there.,"I've been to Canada twice in my life, but I should go more often because I have family there. It's important for me to strengthen my connection with them and create more lasting memories.",It sounds like you value family ties and you would like to create more memories in Canada. Let's break this down - the fact is that you've been to Canada twice and you feel the need to go more often. These are two separate things: the number of your visits and your feelings or thoughts about it.,"That's true. I know objectively that I've only been to Canada twice and the reality is, I don't visit as often as I'd like. I have this inner need or desire to strengthen my bonds with my family there. It's just sometimes challenging to reconcile the facts and my emotions about it.","I understand how you feel. Let's try to see it from different perspectives. Besides visiting more frequently, what other ways can you think of that might help you to strengthen your family ties and create more lasting memories with your family in Canada? Perhaps you could consider virtual gatherings, letter exchanges, or even planning trips together. The frequency of visits is one aspect, but how about the quality of the interactions you could have in between or during visits? Could these also contribute to stronger bonds and memorable experiences?","You're right, I haven't really thought about other means of fortifying my bonds with them apart from visiting. I guess I could start by having more video calls with them, sending them letters, or even planning a trip somewhere together. Those are great suggestions. I suppose the quality of our interactions does matter more than the frequency. It's just I've been so focused on the physical aspect of being there. This gives me a different perspective to consider. Thank you.","I'm really glad to hear that you're open to these new ideas and approaches. It's completely understandable that you've been focused on the idea of physically being there, given the importance you place on family connection. However, remember that strengthening relationships often lies in the quality of connection, not just the physical proximity. These diverse ways, such as video calls, letters or joint trip planning can enrich your interactions and create wonderful memories, even from a distance. Trust in your ability to maintain these cherished connections with your family in Canada, no matter how far you may be.",
813,Catastrophizing,I baked for the church social and my fudge didn't win the prize. They'll never ask me again!,I feel disappointed and frustrated that my fudge didn't win the prize at the church social. I had put in a lot of effort and was really hoping to impress everyone with my baking skills. Now I worry that they'll never ask me again to contribute anything to future events.,"I understand you're feeling disappointed about not winning the prize. Let's try and separate the situation and your thoughts for a moment. So, the situation is: you made fudge for the church social, but it did not win the prize. Now, let's look at your thoughts about this: you're concerned that people at your church will no longer see you as a valuable contributor to events. Is that right?","Yes, that's right. I feel like not winning the prize might make everyone think less of my contributions and that they might not want my involvement in the future.","I see why you might feel that way, but let's consider some other possibilities. Is it possible that people at the church social enjoyed your fudge even though it didn't win the prize? Or perhaps people admire the effort and dedication you showed by participating? Could it also be that your contributions for the future events are not only based around winning prizes? What are some other possibilities you could think of?","Well, when I think about it, there were many people who told me they enjoyed my fudge. I remember seeing some of them go back for seconds. And a few people did say they appreciated that I'm always willing to contribute to these events. So maybe you’re right. Perhaps they do value my participation, regardless of whether or not I win. And yeah, my contribution to future events could be seen in a broader sense, not just in terms of winning prizes.","You've done an excellent job reframing these thoughts. You've pointed out that many did enjoy your fudge and even went for seconds, which is a win in its own right. Remember, it's not just about winning, but also about participating, sharing, and bringing people together, which you clearly contribute to these events. They appreciate your efforts, and I hope you can see that your value in their eyes - and in your own - extends far beyond whether or not you win a prize. Keep contributing and remember to enjoy the process. The true victory is in the positive impact you make on your community.",
814,Personalization,Our soccer team lost the last game. I'm sure it's because I'm a terrible player.,"I feel really down and disappointed because our soccer team lost the last game. I can't help but think that it's all because of me, that I'm a terrible player.",I understand you're feeling down about the soccer game and it sounds like you're taking a lot of responsibility for the loss. You're linking your performance in this single game with your overall ability as a player. Let's try to separate the game result from your personal skillset.,You're right. It's just one game and my worth as a player isn't based on a single game. I must remember that everyone has good and bad games and it doesn't mean that I am a terrible player overall.,"Absolutely, one game doesn't define your entire ability. It's great that you can see this. Now, let's think about some other possible explanations for the loss. Can you think of any other factors that might have contributed to the result besides your individual performance? For example, could the game have been influenced by the team's overall coordination, strategy, or even unforeseen variables such as weather conditions or the other team's performance that day?","Yes, when I think about it, there were a lot of factors that probably contributed to our loss. Our team's coordination was off, and the other team was really strong, they had players who are much more experienced. The weather wasn't that great either. I guess it's not fair for me to internalize the loss as entirely my fault.","I'm glad to see that you're starting to understand there were a variety of factors at play in the game result. It's indeed unfair to put the entire burden on yourself. Soccer is a team sport and the outcome depends on many things: team coordination, strategy, weather conditions, and the ability of the opposing team. Remember, it's fine to take responsibility for your actions, but it's not productive to shoulder all the blame. Strive to learn from this experience and use these insights to strengthen your skills and strategies for the next game. Keep practicing, your worth as a player isn't determined by one single game. Keep your chin up!",
815,Personalization,I'm stuck in this wheelchair because I wasn't careful in my life.,I'm stuck in this wheelchair because I wasn't careful in my life.,"I hear your frustration and regret. But let me highlight, being in a wheelchair is the situation, your thoughts about it being due to your lack of care is separate. Let's explore this further, why do you think not being careful led you to this situation?","I guess because I've always been a bit reckless, never really considering the consequences of my actions. I lived for the thrill and excitement of the moment, but I feel that it's that lack of caution that led to the accident that put me in this wheelchair. I blame myself for this.","I truly understand that you're feeling regretful and blaming yourself. However, is it also possible that the thrill and excitement that you loved is a part of who you are and it just comes with some risks, just like any lifestyle? There might have been consequences, but isn't it also possible that these experiences have contributed to some unique strengths and garnered a set of potent experiences and skills? What if we consider that?","Yes, that's true. I have always embraced risk and loved the thrill it brought. It's part of who I am. I guess it did help me learn a lot and acquire a unique set of skills. It's quite possible that these experiences contributed to my strengths. But still, the regret of ending up in this wheelchair is really hard to let go. But I'm open to considering a new perspective. Perhaps blaming myself isn't really helping.","It's genuinely inspiring to see you acknowledge your love for thrill and risk, and moreover, recognize the unique abilities you've acquired through this journey of yours. The past teaches us valuable lessons but dwelling in self-blame can be paralyzing. Yes, life has put you in a wheelchair, but remember, it doesn't take away your strength, your experiences, or who you are. It can be challenging to release the regret, but allow yourself to start the process of forgiving yourself. Who knows, you might find a new strength in this unexpected life journey.",
816,Catastrophizing,My apartment in New York City smells bad. Maybe there is a gas leak that will kill me.,I've been feeling really anxious lately because I keep thinking about the smell in my apartment in New York City. I'm starting to worry that there might be a gas leak and it's really freaking me out. I can't help but think that it's going to kill me.,"I understand your anxiety. Now, let's first separate the situation from your thoughts. The situation is you've noticed a certain smell in your apartment. The thought is that it might be a gas leak that could harm you.","You're right. The situation is that there's an unpleasant smell in my apartment. My thought, on the other hand, is that it could be a dangerous gas leak. This thought is making me feel extremely anxious and scared for my life.","I see why you would be concerned. Now, let's try to think of other possibilities for the smell. It could be from a number of non-dangerous sources such as leftover food, an odorous trash, or some mildew from damp areas. Could there be any other possible reason for the smell?","True, there could be other explanations for this bad smell. Maybe I left something in the garbage for too long, or there's a damp spot somewhere causing the smell, or maybe I need to clean my kitchen more exhaustively. There are indeed other more benign possibilities.","That's a productive thought process! It's great to see you realizing there could be other, less dangerous reasons for the smell. Perhaps you could investigate these more benign possibilities first. Anxiety can sometimes make us jump to worst-case scenarios, but remember there's often a simpler explanation at hand. Let's maintain this rational thinking approach as you explore and address the situation in your apartment.",
817,Labeling and mislabeling,"I was unable to save up enough for my Disney World trip this year, clearly I am a failure as an employee.",I'm feeling really down because I wasn't able to save up enough money for my Disney World trip this year. It's making me feel like a complete failure as an employee.,"I see that not being able to save up enough for your Disney World trip is causing you distress. However, it's crucial to separate this situation from your worth as an employee. Let's try to do that. Is your ability to save money for a trip the sole determinant of your success at work?","No, I suppose it isn't. I mean, I do my job well and get positive feedback from my managers. I guess the inability to save doesn't necessarily make me a failure at my work. But it's just disheartening not to have the funds for this trip I was really looking forward to.","I understand that you're feeling disheartened about not being able to afford the trip. It's normal to feel disappointed in such situations. However, can we explore other possibilities? For example, could there have been unexpected expenses this year or maybe savings went into some other important expenditures? Also, considering your good performance at work, is there a chance for a salary raise in the near future?","Yes, you're right. This year was a little rough financially because of some unforeseen medical expenses. And yes, there is a possibility of a salary raise next year. I think I was just focusing too much on this one setback.","It's great that you can see the bigger picture now. You've had some unexpected expenses, which would have been hard for anyone to plan for. What's important is that you've managed to handle these without getting into debt. You're acknowledged at your work, and there may even be a salary raise on the horizon. Remember, one setback doesn't define our entire life or career. You're much more resilient and resourceful than you think. And who knows? You might make it to Disney World next year.",
818,Overgeneralization,I am currently a stay at home mom while my husband is the sole provider. My husband was very late to dinner the other day. He will probably never be on time for dinner again.,I have been feeling frustrated lately because my husband was very late to dinner the other day. It made me feel like he doesn't value my time or effort in preparing the meal. I can't help but worry that this might become a pattern and he will never be on time for dinner again.,"I see. The situation is your husband arrived late to dinner which was disappointing for you. Your thought is that he might consistently be late in the future, thus showing a lack of respect for your time and effort. Is this an accurate understanding of what you are feeling?","Yes, that's exactly what I'm feeling. It's like a worst-case scenario is always playing in my mind. I'm afraid he doesn't see the value in what I do at home and spending time as a family over dinner. It's my way of contributing to the family, and his coming back late might belittle my contribution. I'm worried if this continues, it might lead to more issues in our marriage.","I understand your concerns perfectly. It's natural to fear the worst-case scenario, especially when it relates to something as important as your family life and marriage. However, let's try to consider other possibilities. Could there be other reasons, unrelated to his appreciation of your efforts, that might explain why he was late? Could it be possible he had an unexpected work obligation or got caught in traffic? Trying this approach might help us see a bit more clearly if the concern lies in his attitude or some external factors. What do you think?","Indeed, when I think about it that way—there could be other reasons why he was late. It's possible that he had a meeting that ran late or encountered unexpected traffic. However, it's the lack of communication about coming home late that is disturbing to me. I assume the worst because I'm not given any information. So, possibly, what needs to change isn't his punctuality but the communication between us about these things.","I'm really glad to see you come up with a new understanding of your situation. You've made an important step in realizing that the issue might not be about your husband's tardiness, but rather about a lack of communication in your relationship, which is essential for any successful partnership. It's completely alright to feel concerned, but remember, communication bridges gaps. How about having a calm, open conversation with him about how his late arrivals affect you and the importance of keeping each other informed about late arrivals or changes in schedule? This might gently encourage him to see it from your perspective and make necessary changes. I believe in you.",
819,Catastrophizing,My favorite comic was out of stock today. They probably cancelled it and I'll never get to read it again.,I'm feeling really disappointed and upset right now because my favorite comic was sold out today. I can't help but think that they might have cancelled it altogether and I'll never be able to read it again. It's frustrating and I don't know how to deal with these emotions.,I understand that you're really upset because you couldn't get your favorite comic today. It's natural to feel disappointed when you can't access something that you enjoy. But let's try to separate the situation - the comic being sold out today - from the thought - the worry that it might be cancelled.,"You're right, I was letting my disappointment take over and jump to worst-case scenarios. The comic being sold out doesn't necessarily mean that it's been cancelled. I need to separate the facts from my fears.","That's a great start! Now, let's try to think about other possibilities. The comic being sold out could mean various things. It could be really popular and sold quickly, or maybe the store didn't order enough this time. There are many more possibilities besides it being cancelled. What other alternatives can you think of?","You're right, there could be other reasons why the comic was sold out. Maybe they're re-stocking or maybe I just went a little late and the copies sold out before I got there. It's also possible that there's a delay in delivery or they're planning a special edition. I should try not to instantaneously assume the worst.","Absolutely, you've identified plenty of great possibilities there. Remember, it's okay to feel disappointed when things don't go as planned. But reframing our thoughts as you've just done opens up a whole new set of possibilities, and often, those are far less negative. Keep doing this whenever you start jumping to worst-case scenarios, it will help maintain a more balanced perspective. Your love for the comic can be a driving force to find out more before assuming the worst. Keep going!",
820,Labeling and mislabeling,I wore glasses as a kid and quit wearing them because people think I am stupid. I quit wearing them now.,"I used to wear glasses as a kid, but I stopped wearing them because I feel like people think I'm stupid when I have them on. Now, I don't wear them anymore.","I see. So, the situation here is that you need glasses to see clearly, but you stopped wearing them because you believe people consider you less intelligent when you do. Now, you choose not to wear them at all. Am I correct?","Yes, you understood correctly. I stopped wearing my glasses because I was worried about people's perception of me based on this. I feel judged and considered less intelligent just due to my glasses.","I understand where you're coming from. But let's consider some alternative interpretations of the same situation. Could there be a chance that other people might see your glasses as a sign of being intellectual or focused? Or maybe they don't think anything about it at all, as many people these days wear glasses due to eyesight issues or even as a fashion statement. What are your thoughts on these possibilities?","You have a point. Maybe I'm overthinking the whole situation and projecting my insecurity on other people's opinions. It could genuinely be the case that people don't view me as less smart because of my glasses, or they might even perceive me as more intellectual. The fear of judgment might really be in my head.","That's a valuable insight! It's indeed possible that what we think others perceive about us is merely a reflection of our own insecurities. I am glad you're opening up to different perspectives. Remember, your glasses are a tool for your benefit, not a measure of your intelligence. Your worth and intellect are not determined by external appearances but by your character, actions, and abilities. It's great that you can consider these new viewpoints, and I would encourage you to continue exploring this way of thinking.",
821,Should statements,"My three dogs are really annoying, they should realize how much work it is taking care of them, and be nicer to me.","I have three dogs, and lately, I've been finding them really annoying. It's like they don't appreciate all the effort and work I put into taking care of them. I wish they could be nicer to me.","I understand that you're feeling unappreciated by your dogs. Now, let's separate the situation and your feelings. You have three dogs, and you're putting a lot of effort into taking care of them. This is the situation. The thought here is that they are not showing appreciation for your efforts, which makes you feel annoyed and makes you wish they were nicer to you, am I correct?","Yes, that's correct. I feel like I'm investing so much into their well-being, physically and emotionally. And at times when they misbehave or don't behave as I expect them to, I feel overwhelmed and unappreciated.","I see where you're coming from, but let's try to explore some other possible explanations for their behavior. Dogs have different ways of showing gratitude and love that may not always align with our expectations. Perhaps we can consider the idea that their ""misbehaviors"" aren't intentional signs of disrespect or ingratitude. Can you think of any other possibles reasons they might be behaving the way they do?","Well, one of my dogs is still quite young, so maybe he's just being a typical puppy and needs more time to train. As for my other dogs, I sometimes think they get excited and energetic, which I often interpret as them being naughty or rebellious. Maybe they just have a lot of energy they need to burn? I also consider that they may not understand that their actions could be hard on me. They are dogs after all, not humans. They can’t really comprehend human emotions and stress in the way we do.","You've shown great insight by understanding that your dogs behave differently due to their age, energy levels, or simply because they are dogs and not capable of human understanding. It's a great step towards a more positive perspective. Remember, their actions aren't intended to upset or disrespect you. They love and depend on you, the way they express it can be different. It could be helpful to see their energy and 'misbehaviour' as signs of their health and vitality, and their interaction with you, even if it's energetic, is their way of bonding. With time, patience, understanding, and positive reinforcement, I'm sure you and your dogs can find a more harmonious rhythm.",
822,Jumping to conclusions: Fortune-telling,"I live in New York City, so I am certain to die from mugging stabbing or shooting.","I live in New York City, so I am constantly afraid that I will be a victim of a mugging, stabbing, or shooting. I feel like my life is always at risk because of where I live.",I hear your fear and understand it's rooted in living in New York City. Is it always the case that living in New York City will inevitably result in falling victim to a crime? What are some other aspects about this city?,"You're right. New York is a huge city with lots of different areas and lots of different people. Not all areas or people are dangerous. Just because I live here, it doesn't directly mean I'll certainly fall victim to a crime. There are many aspects of this city that I love and feel safe, like my neighborhood, my friends, or even public places that are well-protected. It's also one of the most diverse and culturally rich cities worldwide and full of opportunities. It's not fair to only focus on the potential danger.","I really appreciate your openness to see things from a different perspective. Now, let's expand on that. Given what you just said, can you think of any other possibilities to feel safer in the city or ways that living in New York might actually benefit you?","Yes, you're correct. Living in New York not only presents dangers but also countless opportunities for growth and enrichment. The diversity and cultural richness provide me with the chance to learn and become more broad-minded. Besides, I could adopt some personal safety measures like being cautious at night or in unfamiliar areas, learning some self-defense techniques, or even joining a neighborhood watch group. New York City also boasts robust police force presence and various safety measures which can make me feel safer as well. Plus, there are countless industries here offering job opportunities that I may not find in smaller cities. There are also world-class hospitals, institutions, museums, parks and so much more. It's all about how I perceive the city.","It's inspiring to see how you're reframing your initial fear into something far more balanced and positive. The precautions you're considering are smart and practical, they'll indeed increase your personal safety. And remember, New York City has a lot more to offer beyond these concerns. Its vast diversity, cultural richness, opportunities for career and personal growth are all aspects that contribute to its uniqueness. Embrace these opportunities while being mindful of your safety. See the city for its potential and not just the threats. This mindset will make your experience living in New York rewarding and gratifying. Happy living in the city that never sleeps!",
823,Should statements,"I should be living closer to an orchard, but that's impossible","I often find myself thinking that I should be living closer to an orchard, but it feels impossible for me to achieve that. It's a dream I have, but it seems out of reach.","It sounds like your current living situation and your dream of living closer to an orchard are intersecting here. Let's separate them: your situation is where you live now, and your thought is your desire to live near an orchard. Would that be an accurate description?","Yes, you're right. I currently live in the city and while it has its conveniences, I have always dreamed of living a more rural life, especially near an orchard. It just seems so peaceful and calming. But with my job and other commitments, it doesn't seem like I could ever make it happen.",Completely changing your lifestyle by moving closer to an orchard might seem daunting right now. But let's think about this from other perspectives. Are there other possible ways you could incorporate elements of this dream into your current life? Could you perhaps visit an orchard regularly? Or maybe there's a chance to work remotely that would allow you to move? Let's explore other possible scenarios that might bring you closer to your dream.,"That's an interesting perspective. I haven't really thought about it that way. Maybe I could try to visit an orchard nearby during the weekends or vacation days. As for the job, I could try to speak with my boss about possibilities of working remotely. There might just be a way to make my dream come true that I hadn't considered before. Thank you, this has really helped me.","I'm really glad to hear you coming up with these fantastic alternative strategies to achieve your dream. It's a great step toward living the life you desire. It shows a lot of courage to consider different possibilities and not just focus on the perfect scenario. These changes might not be exactly what you originally had in mind, but they could still bring joy and a sense of peace in your life. Remember, even small steps towards your dream count, you don't need to achieve everything all at once. Keep these new perspectives in mind, and I believe you will find ways to make your dream a reality.",
824,Catastrophizing,"In often get bad dreams, soon I'll become mad.","I've been having a lot of bad dreams lately and it's really starting to worry me. I'm afraid that if they continue, I might end up going crazy.","I understand that you're feeling stressed about your frequent nightmares. Let's try to distinguish your current situation - experiencing nightmares often, and your thought - the fear of going crazy. It's crucial that we don't automatically link the two. Nightmares can be distressing, but they do not necessarily lead to one losing their mind.","Yes, I understand what you're saying. I guess it's been difficult for me to separate the nightmares from the fear of going mad. I know they're not necessarily related, but the fear still persists. I think I need more help to manage this fear and the nightmares.","That's a step in the right direction, acknowledging how you feel is important. Now, let's consider other possibilities in your situation. For instance, have you thought that these nightmares might be your mind's way of dealing with certain stresses you're experiencing or emotions you're not venting during your waking hours? It doesn't necessarily mean you are going crazy but could be a signal that there are issues you need to address. Can you think of other possible explanations or ways to address the nightmares without intensifying your fears?","I guess I haven't really thought about it like that. It's possible that these nightmares are a reflection of the stress I have been under recently at work and in my personal life. I've been bottling up my emotions and not really dealing with them. Maybe that's what my nightmares are trying to signal. I think finding healthy ways to handle my stress could potentially be beneficial, like perhaps exercise or even expressing my feelings more openly.","That's a very insightful observation. Dreams, including nightmares, can indeed be a reflection of our inner emotions and stresses. It's really great to see you come to the understanding that these dreams may be signaling a need for more well-rounded stress management in your life. I encourage you to continue this perspective. Regular exercise and opening up about your feelings, as you mentioned, could possibly be beneficial not only for improving your overall mental health but also reducing your nightmares. Remember, experiencing nightmares doesn't mean you're going crazy, but it's your mind's unique way of expressing itself.",
825,Discounting the positive,I am recently divorce i am happy now but i will probably be lonely forever.,"I am recently divorced and although I am feeling happy right now, I can't shake the thought that I will probably be lonely forever.",I understand that you're enjoying your newfound freedom post-divorce but are also fearful of potential loneliness. It seems like your current situation - being freshly divorced - and your thoughts of perpetual loneliness are intertwined. Is it okay to explore these feelings a bit further?,"Yes, I think exploring these feelings could be beneficial for me. I want to understand why I'm feeling this way while I also feel happy.","That's a great approach. Remember that feelings aren't fixed, they are complex and layered. It's completely natural for you to feel both happy and fearful at the same time. A divorce is a significant change and it can take time to adjust to your new situation. Instead of thinking you'll be lonely forever, can you think of other possibilities following your divorce? For example, could this be a chance for self-discovery? Or an opportunity to develop new hobbies, forge new friendships, or spend quality time by yourself? What do you think about these possibilities?",I hadn't really considered those possibilities before. I suppose this could be a chance for self-discovery and to find new activities that I enjoy. I don't know why I immediately jumped to the idea of being lonely forever. It seems like I've been too focused on the downside instead of viewing it as a new chapter in my life. I think spending some quality time with myself and finding what truly makes me happy could be a good place to start. Thank you for helping me see things from a different perspective.,"I'm glad to hear that you're starting to see things differently. Embracing new perspectives is often the first step to managing our fears and misconceptions. You've unearthed some wonderful possibilities that lie ahead of you. Remember, it's perfectly alright to enjoy your independence and still have concerns about the future. Continue exploring these new opportunities with an open mind—you're starting on a journey of self-discovery that could be very rewarding. I'm here to support you in this process, so let's keep discussing any concerns or fears that arise along the way. Be patient and kind to yourself; transformation takes time.",
826,Personalization,"My mom ate my salad and didn't say a word, it's because I am a horrible cook.",I feel really upset and frustrated because I made a salad for myself and my mom ate it without saying anything. It's made me think that I must be a horrible cook for her to not even acknowledge it.,I can see why you'd be frustrated. The situation is your mom ate your salad without saying anything. But the thought connected to it is that you may be a bad cook because of her silence. These two are quite different.,"Yes, I understand they are different situations. But still, her silence made me feel like I'm terrible at cooking.","I can certainly understand why you might feel that way, but let's consider some other possibilities. Could there be any other reasons why your mom didn't mention the salad? Perhaps she was preoccupied with something else, was not aware you made it just for yourself, or simply forgot to mention it. What else do you believe could possibly have happened?","Maybe she was indeed preoccupied with something else or simply didn't want to say anything because I made the salad just for myself. You're right, it may not necessarily mean that I'm terrible at cooking.","Exactly, you've got it! It's possible her silence had nothing to do with your cooking skills and could have been due to any number of reasons like we brainstormed. You shouldn't undervalue your abilities based on assumptions. Cooking is a skill that can always be improved with practice, no one is born a master chef. You're doing just fine. Keep exploring and you might find out you're a much better cook than you give yourself credit for!",
827,Mental filtering,My favorite food is pizza but that's such a common answer it becomes irrelevant.,I often find myself feeling guilty for having such a common favorite food like pizza. I worry that my answer becomes irrelevant or uninteresting because so many people share the same preference. It makes me question if my opinions and choices are even worth expressing.,"I see that you have a favorite food, pizza and that you have thoughts about these preferences being common and therefore uninteresting. Am I correct? It is important to understand that the situation - enjoying a popular food, is separate from the thought - fearing your preferences are uninteresting. Let's examine this.","Yes, you're correct. I do enjoy pizza and its popularity makes me feel as if my preferences are ordinary and uninteresting. I would like to be more unique in my choices, but I often find myself going back to what I enjoy, which also happens to be what many others enjoy. Let's explore this further.","That's a great step forward. Having common preferences doesn't always mean you are commonplace or uninteresting. What other ways can we look at the situation? For instance, could it be possible that your enjoyment of pizza gives you something in common with many people and can be a starting point to connect with others or discuss favorite toppings, recipes, and other unique experiences? What other perspectives might you consider?","That's an interesting perspective. You're right, sharing a common preference can indeed be a conversation starter and help me connect with others. Also, varying choices of toppings and styles of pizza can make each pizza experience unique too. Maybe, instead of feeling ordinary, I can look at this shared preference as a delightful common denominator, something relatable in a diverse world. I never really looked at it this way.","That's a fantastic reframing of your initial thought. You've recognized pizza as not just a food item, but as a gateway for connection and shared enjoyment with others. Your pizza preference can be perceived as a common thread in a tapestry of unique choices and experiences, thus making you relatable, rather than uninteresting. It's wonderful to see you explore new perspectives and understand that commonalities can also contribute to our uniqueness. Let's continue on this path, fostering a healthier approach to interpreting our thoughts and choices.",
828,Labeling and mislabeling,One of my students got a D on the quiz. I am the worst teacher in the middle school.,I feel like such a failure as a teacher because one of my students got a D on the quiz.,It's evident that you're upset about your student's score. But do you think it's fair to associate one student's performance with your overall capabilities as a teacher?,"I guess it's not entirely fair to judge my teaching abilities based on one student's performance, but it still makes me question my effectiveness sometimes.","I can understand why you might feel that way, but let's consider some other possibilities. Could their low quiz score be due to outside factors like their study habits, personal issues, or perhaps they didn't grasp that particular topic well? Could there be more students who have improved under your guidance? We should think about this from various angles.","You're correct, there might be other factors influencing the student's quiz performance that are outside of my control. And yes, there are other students who have been improving, I shouldn't overlook that. I guess I tend to be too hard on myself sometimes.","I appreciate your ability to see the broader perspective. That shows both your integrity and dedication as a teacher who deeply cares for her students’ performance. Remember, a single quiz doesn't define your teaching abilities or your student's overall learning. Focus on continual improvement and cultivating resilience in your students - that's a part of being a fantastic teacher, which you certainly are. It's important to be kind to yourself through this process just as you would be with your students.",
829,Personalization,"I'm bipolar, so I can never be a real success at nursing.",I've been feeling really down lately and have been having these thoughts that I can never be a real success at nursing because I'm bipolar. It's been really discouraging and I don't know what to do about it.,"It sounds like you're experiencing a challenging time, especially regarding your nursing career and your bipolar condition. Let's break this down: the situation is that you're a nurse and you're also dealing with bipolar disorder. However, your thought is that these two situations can't coexist successfully. That's quite a tough mindset to struggle with.","Yes, it really is. I feel like my condition is going to hold me back in my career. I worry it makes me less capable than my peers who don't have a mental health condition, and that I'll never be able to reach my full potential.","I understand your concerns and they are valid. However, let's consider some other possibilities. What if your bipolar disorder didn't hold you back but instead gave you unique insights and empathy that others may not have? Or perhaps, it pushes you to develop resilience and coping mechanisms that can be helpful not just for you but also for your patients. Could you see it possibly contributing to your competence and growth as a nurse in some way?","I’ve never considered it that way. I suppose it's possible that my experiences with mental health could equip me with a certain level of understanding and empathy for patients who might be dealing with similar issues. But it's hard for me to believe that, especially when I'm having a hard time. I'll try to keep that perspective in mind.","I'm truly glad to hear that you're open to embracing a new perspective. It certainly may not be easy, especially during challenging days, but remember that many aspects of life, including your bipolar disorder, can contribute to our personal and professional growth in ways we might not initially foresee. It's okay to have doubts. Just try to remember that your unique experiences don't necessarily limit you, but can potentially make you an understanding, empathetic, and resilient nurse. Hang in there, okay?",
830,Catastrophizing,"One of my cats is missing, maybe she was killed by a car.",I'm feeling really worried and sad because one of my cats has been missing for a few days now. I can't help but think that maybe she got hit by a car and something bad has happened to her. It's been unbearable not knowing where she is or if she's alright.,"It's understandable that you're worried about your missing cat. The situation is that your cat has been missing for a few days now. Your thoughts about the situation are that you fear she may have been hit by a car. Remember, it's the situation that's real, and your thoughts are assumptions you've made about that situation.",You're right. I know that my thoughts are just my fears and assumptions since I don't really know what happened to my cat. Understanding the difference between what's real and what's just my assumption does help to calm my anxiety a bit. But I can't help but feel worried and fearful for her.,"That’s a great step to acknowledge that your thought is just one possibility. Your anxiety is understandable, given how much you care for your pet. But let's think about other possible scenarios. Might she have wandered off and gotten a bit lost? Could a neighbor have taken her in not realizing she has a home already? Maybe she's found a hiding spot and is simply in deep sleep? It's also possible she's discovered a new hangout spot and will be back when she's tired. What do you think about these other possibilities?","You're right, there are other possibilities that I haven't considered. Maybe she did wander off a bit too far and got lost, or maybe one of the neighbors took her in. She also has a knack for finding the strangest places to nap, so she could be hiding out somewhere. These other scenarios do bring me a bit of relief, and I'll hold onto the hope that she's safe somewhere and will come back home soon. Thank you for helping me see things from different perspectives.","I'm really glad to hear that you're starting to consider other possibilities and that it's bringing you some relief. These scenarios you've thought of are all very plausible, considering a cat's curious nature. It shows that you recognize a wide range of potential realities beyond what you were initially focused on. That's a really valuable perspective. Continue focusing on these alternative outcomes, and don't hesitate to seek help from neighbors or the local animal shelter. It's a tough situation but remember to stay positive and hopeful. Acknowledge your emotions and fears, but don't let them control your thinking. Your cat is lucky to have such a caring owner.

831,Labeling and mislabeling,I struck out while playing softball.  I'm the worst batter in history.,I struck out while playing softball. I'm the worst batter in history.,"It's important to separate the event of striking out while playing softball from the thought that this makes you the worst batter in history. Striking out is something that happens to everyone, even professional athletes. Your worth as a batter is not determined by a single instance.","Follow your treatment steps: 

You're right, I need to take things into perspective and not be so hard on myself over one strike out. I understand that even the best have their unlucky moments, and I cannot see myself as the 'worst batter in history' based on one event.","That's a great start! Also remember, there might be multiple factors involved when you strike out. Maybe you're having an off day or the pitcher was particularly good. Can you think of other possible reasons that may have contributed to this particular outcome? Reflecting on these possibilities can help you see the situation more objectively and prevent you from generalizing one instance to your overall ability.","Yes, I see how this makes sense now. Perhaps I was too tired or maybe, the pitcher was unusually good on that day. I could have been distracted by something, or maybe I just need more practice. It's clear that this one instance does not define my overall ability or skill. I'll keep in mind that there are several factors that could have led to this outcome. Striking out is part of the game, and it gives me an opportunity to improve.","I commend your positive approach and healthy perspective on this. You've brainstormed many possible contributing factors and it reflects your understanding that a single event doesn't define you or your skills. Keep in mind, every failure or setback is a learning opportunity and part of the growth process. You are not the worst batter in history, you're a player gaining experience and every strike out brings you one step closer to your next hit. Continue with this mindset, it will help build resilience not only in softball but in life too.",
832,Jumping to conclusions: mind reading,No one is hiring me for publishing jobs. They've probably heard bad rumors about me.,I've been feeling really down lately because it seems like no one is hiring me for any publishing jobs. I can't help but wonder if there are some negative rumors or perceptions about me that are affecting my chances of getting hired.,"I understand you're feeling distressed about your job search. It's important to remember though that your current situation — searching for a job in publishing — is separate from your thoughts about possible negative rumors about you. Could it be possible that there are other factors at play, rather than a potential negative perception about you?","Yes, I suppose that could be possible. There could be various other factors like my experience, skills or even the competition in the market. However, it's just hard not to leap to the worst conclusion.","Absolutely. It's natural to sometimes jump to worst-case scenarios in our minds, especially when things aren't going as planned. But as you mentioned, the job market indeed involves numerous factors including competition, specific qualifications, and even timing. Maybe it would helpful to brainstorm about some other possibilities. For instance, could it be that your perfect job just hasn't opened up yet? Or perhaps there's an opportunity to acquire new skills that would make your portfolio even more attractive? Or maybe it's just a particularly tough time in the publishing industry? Let's try to think creatively and flexibly about this situation.","You're right. I could definitely be missing out on some opportunities because the right job has not come up yet or maybe because I need to improve or update my skills. It could also be the market conditions which is out of my control. Instead of assuming the worst, I can use this time to further develop my skills and improve my chances. I guess I need to be more patient and proactive instead of getting stuck in the negative thoughts.","That's an excellent reframing of your situation. Feeling rejected can often lead us to negative thinking, but acknowledging these other possibilities shows a real strength. Remember, being patient doesn't mean you're inactive. You're planning, learning, and growing. I believe in your capability to navigate through these circumstances. Keep focusing on what you can control — improving your skills and staying alert for the right opportunities — instead of worrying about potential rumors or perceptions. You'll become an even stronger candidate as a result. Keep believing in yourself.",
833,Labeling and mislabeling,"I forgot to bring my gloves for climbing, I am a useless climber.","I forgot to bring my gloves for climbing, I am a useless climber. I feel so frustrated and disappointed in myself.",It seems like you are feeling down because you forgot your gloves. Is it fair to say that you are associating one mistake with a judgement about your overall abilities as a climber?,"Yes, that's correct. I just feel like if I was a good climber, I wouldn't forget something as essential as my gloves. It's making me question my abilities and self-worth as a climber.","I understand how you're feeling. Consider this, could there be other possibilities? For example, could it be that even the most experienced climbers might occasionally forget their gloves, or that forgetting your gloves could be a simple oversight rather than a sign of incompetence? Can you think of other alternative explanations?","Yes, I guess that's possible. Experienced climbers are human after all, and humans do forget things sometimes, so I suppose they might forget their gloves as well. I guess forgetting could be due to a lot of factors and not just incompetence. Perhaps I was preoccupied with other thoughts, or I was in a rush and didn't double check everything. Thank you, considering these alternatives makes me feel a bit better.","Absolutely, you've hit the nail on the head. It's completely human to forget things, especially when we're preoccupied or in a rush. Forgetting your gloves doesn't make you incompetent or a bad climber. In fact, acknowledging this and thinking through possible reasons demonstrates your ability to learn and adapt. It's crucial to be gentle with yourself when these things happen. It does not define your worth or ability as a climber. You're doing great! Let's remember this the next time something similar happens.",
834,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,"I wish I was taller so I could reach the cookie jar, my life is ruined and I'll never be able to get a cookie.","I wish I was taller so I could reach the cookie jar. It feels frustrating and disappointing that I am unable to do something as simple as getting a cookie. It makes me feel like my life is ruined and that I will never be able to enjoy the things I want.

Now, I will guide you through some treatment steps to help address these thoughts and feelings:

1. Validate your feelings: It's completely normal to feel frustrated and disappointed when you believe you can't achieve something you desire. It's important to acknowledge and accept these emotions.

2. Challenge the thought: Let's analyze the belief that your life is ruined simply because you can't reach the cookie jar. Is this thought rational or might it be an exaggeration? Are there other ways you can satisfy your desire for a cookie?

3. Adjust the focus: Instead of solely focusing on what you can't do, let's explore other aspects of your life that bring you happiness and fulfillment. What are your strengths and achievements? This can help broaden your perspective and lessen the significance of not being able to reach the cookie jar.

4. Set realistic goals: If your height is something that genuinely bothers you, let's discuss realistic strategies to cope with this concern. For instance, improving your self-esteem, developing new skills unrelated to height, or finding alternative ways to reach the cookie jar.

5. Foster self-acceptance: Embracing who you are, including your physical attributes, is essential for developing a positive self-image. Let's work on self-acceptance and self-love, recognizing that height is just one aspect of your identity and not a measure of your worth.

6. Explore other sources of happiness: While cookies may be a temporary source of satisfaction, it's beneficial to identify other sources of joy in your life. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, pursuing personal goals, and participating in activities that bring fulfillment can enhance your overall well-being.

Remember, therapy is a collaborative process. We can work together to address and overcome challenges, ultimately helping you lead a more fulfilled life.","You're feeling quite frustrated and disappointed because you're not able to reach the cookie jar due to your height. It seems like this situation is leading you to some pretty intense thoughts, like your life is ruined. Let's separate the situation itself – you wanting a cookie but being unable to reach it – from the thought that this difficulty means your life is ruined. It's important to acknowledge that these are two distinct things: the situation and your thoughts about it.","Exactly! You have expressed your feelings correctly and made a clear distinction between the situation and your thoughts about it. Now, let's challenge this thought. Is it true that your life is ruined because you can't reach the cookie jar? Could we perhaps consider the idea that this is only a momentary setback, not a complete end of all happiness? There might be other ways to obtain a cookie. The conclusion that your life is ruined might be an exaggeration of the current situation, born out of frustration or disappointment. It's crucial to remember that not being able to get a cookie doesn't diminish your worth or value. 
Let's also think of other aspects of your life that make you happy. Your abilities, the things you enjoy doing, and your achievements in life. Focusing on these points can help you view the situation from a broader perspective and reduce the stress caused by not reaching the cookie jar. It could be a great idea to set realistic goals and find practical alternatives to get what you desire. After all, your height doesn’t define you. It’s about fostering self-acceptance and self-love - recognizing that this is just one part of you, and not a determinant of your worth. And always remember, cookies can bring momentary joy, but there are many other sources of long-term happiness in life.","It sounds like you've already started reframing your situation a bit, which is great! Let's continue brainstorming. Can you think of other ways to get to the cookie jar, even if you're not tall enough to reach it without assistance? Could there be tools or methods you haven't thought of yet? Besides, are there other sources of fulfillment aside from the cookie jar? Remember, it's the very challenge that makes the reward even sweeter!","Great job! It seems like you've done excellent work reframing your thought already. Yes, there are indeed a plethora of other means to reach the cookie jar. Perhaps you could use a stool or ask someone taller for help. Remember, sometimes you need a different perspective and not height to reach what you desire. Moreover, focusing on different aspects of life can also bring you fulfillment and happiness. It might be spending quality time with your loved ones, reading a good book, performing a hobby, or savoring a meal you enjoy, these are all sources of long-lasting happiness. As you beautifully put it, overcoming a challenge indeed makes the reward sweeter! You're doing well on this journey of managing and understanding your thoughts. Through continued practice of these techniques, you can better manage your feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction. Remember, it's all about embracing your unique self and finding satisfaction beyond immediate wants. Keep up the good work!","I truly admire the way you've taken this situation as an opportunity for brainstorming and growth. Your ideas about how to reach the cookie jar, like using a stool or asking someone for help, are absolutely commendable! Equally impressive is your realization that other sources of fulfillment exist beyond the immediate satisfaction of a cookie. This wisdom and flexibility in thinking is a tremendous asset to your personal growth. Remember, it's not the challenges that define us, but how we overcome those challenges. I encourage you to continue applying this reframing strategy to other aspects of your life. Always know that you are more than capable and your value extends far beyond physical traits or momentary setbacks. Keep up this fantastic work!",
835,Mental filtering,"I got hired last week at McDonad's, but there are always too many customers and the place smells of frying oil.","I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my new job at McDonald's. There are always so many customers, and the smell of frying oil is constantly lingering in the air. It's starting to affect my mood and overall well-being.","It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now with your new job at McDonald's. However, it's important to separate the situation, which is the busy environment and the smell of the place, from the thoughts you are having, such as it overwhelming you and impacting your well-being. What are the specific thoughts that come up when you're in these situations at work?","When I'm at work and it gets really busy, I start to feel flustered and stressed. I worry that I won't be able to keep up with the demands of the job or that I'll make a mistake. I feel trapped and uncomfortable due to the constant smell of frying oil, and it keeps reminding me of the pressures of the job. I think to myself, can I really handle this for the long haul? Is this job really for me? All these thoughts contribute to me feeling overwhelmed and distressed.","These feelings of stress and being overwhelmed are valid and understandable, given the fast-paced nature of your job. However, it might be helpful to consider other ways of looking at these scenarios. For example, could the busy environment also be a chance to develop and fine-tune your multitasking and quick-thinking skills? Can the smell of frying oil be associated with something more positive like the aroma of the food people enjoy? Maybe there are other aspects of the job that could be rewarding or enjoyable? Can you think of any different viewpoints here?","Yeah, when you put it that way, I suppose I could look at the intense environment as a challenge and an opportunity to improve my skills - not just something that intimidates me. As for the smell of the frying oil, I hadn't thought about it in the context of it being a part of the food preparation process that many people enjoy. I suppose I could focus more on the part I play in bringing enjoyment to our customers. It's also true that there are parts of the job I like, such as interacting with my coworkers and seeing regular customers. Those are definitely some different viewpoints that can help adjust my perspective. Thank you.","That's a great reframing of your experiences! Remember, it's natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with new challenges. But, seeing these situations as opportunities to grow and adapting a positive perspective like you just did can make a huge difference. Try to focus on these positive aspects like the chance to improve your skills, the joy you bring to customers, and the camaraderie with your coworkers. This new viewpoint could transform your experience at work and help in managing stress. Keep practicing this reframing approach and see how much it can change your experience.",
836,Should statements,"I'm a barista, but I should have a better job by now.","I have been working as a barista for quite some time now, but I can't help feeling that I should have a better job by now. I see my friends and colleagues moving up in their careers, and it makes me question my abilities and choices. It's starting to affect my self-esteem and overall happiness.","I see, you're feeling stuck as a barista while noticing others advancing in their careers, which is now starting to impact your happiness. However, it's essential to remember that your feelings are one aspect, and your job situation is another. They are interconnected but not identical. Let's work on separating and addressing them.","Alright, I understand that my feelings are different from my actual job situation. They influence each other, but they're not the same. I can see how I've been mixing the two together and it's only heightened my feelings of inadequacy. Let's work on addressing each separately.","Great, you're seeing the distinction. Now, given your job situation, can we think of other perspectives? For instance, could this job be providing you with skills or experiences that could be beneficial in the long run? Or could it be that your path looks different from your friends, not worse or better but simply different? Could there be growth or opportunities you may have overlooked up until now?","You make a good point. Come to think of it, being a barista has indeed equipped me with certain skills and experiences. I've learned how to manage stress under pressure, handle a team, and develop a knack for customer service, all of which are transferable skills. My journey may look different from my friends, but that doesn't mean it's lesser. Perhaps, I've been too caught up in comparison that I've overlooked my growth and potential opportunities in my current job.","Absolutely, it's fantastic to see you recognizing the valuable skills you've gained as a barista. These are not only transferable but also highly sought after in many other fields. It's indeed easy to get caught up in comparisons, but everyone has their journey. Embrace your unique path as it's shaping you in ways you may not yet fully see. Remember, growth doesn't always look the same for everyone, and the fact that your progress is different doesn't mean it's any less significant. Keep exploring, growing, and recognizing your skills and achievements. You're doing an excellent job.",
837,Mental filtering,I can not believe i have never been to Alaska.  I am so under privlaged and not cultured at all no one will like me until i got o alaska.,I can't believe I've never been to Alaska. I feel so underprivileged and uncultured. I think no one will like me until I go to Alaska.,"It sounds like you're feeling inadequate because you haven't been to Alaska. However, this place doesn't define your entire identity or value. You are bringing these feelings to the situation rather than the situation causing these feelings. Is your likability completely tied to visiting Alaska?","No, when I think about it properly, I know my likability isn't completely tied to visiting Alaska. I think I've been feeling a lack of new experiences, and I believed that visiting Alaska would make me more interesting.",That's an insightful realization. Not having been to Alaska yet doesn't mean you lack interesting experiences. There are other ways to enrich your life and become 'interesting'. Can you think of other experiences or adventures that you could explore to make your life more fulfilling?,"Yes, you're right. I could start pursuing some interests that I've put aside for a while. Perhaps I could take up a new hobby or learn a new skill. I could even start exploring my own city or state more, there's so much around me I haven't seen yet. And who knows, maybe I'll make it to Alaska someday, but until then, I shouldn't let it make me feel less about myself.","That's a wonderful perspective! Exploring your own city and state, learning new skills, and rekindling old interests are all fantastic ways to enrich your life. Remember, everyone has their own path and pace of experiencing life, and not having been to a specific place doesn't lessen your worth or likability. Keep an open mind about what 'culture' could mean. Be proud of your progress and always be open to new experiences. After all, it's your journey that shapes you, not a destination.",
838,Black-and-white or polarized thinking / All or nothing thinking,I love my boat but what if it sinks? I love my partner but they are probably going to leave me...,"I've been having these thoughts lately and it's been really stressing me out. I love my boat so much, but I can't help but worry what would happen if it were to sink. And to add to that, I also love my partner, but I constantly worry that they will eventually leave me. It's making it hard for me to fully enjoy these things in my life.","I see that you're feeling quite anxious about the potential loss of things dear to you, like your boat and your partner. Let's try to separate the situation and your thoughts for a moment. So far, both your boat and relationship are intact, and there are no immediate indications of them failing. Is this understanding correct?","Yes, that's correct. Both my boat and my relationship are intact right now. Even with this, I can't help but worry about their potential failure. I guess I'm feeling really anxious about the possibility of these losses, even if there isn't any immediate indication of them happening.","It's understandable to worry, but let's consider some possible alternatives. For instance, what are some other possible outcomes for your boat and your relationship if things continue as they are? Or what positive developments could occur with your boat and relationship in the future? Keep in mind, nothing in life is certain, but that doesn't mean we can't anticipate good outcomes as well. Can you identify a few possibilities?","Well, I suppose if things continue as they are, my boat could continue to be a source of joy for me, taking me on many future adventures. And my relationship... there's always the possibility that we could grow even closer as we continue to learn more about each other and share experiences. There's even potential for us to start a family in the future. I guess I hadn't taken much time to consider these positive possibilities. It's nice to think about.","That's a great start and a very balanced way of looking at things. You've identified some really positive possibilities for both your boat and relationship. Just as potential problems can exist, so can potential positive developments. It’s crucial to remind yourself of these positive possibilities when anxiety about the future surfaces. It can make your present much more enjoyable knowing that good things can also happen. Remember, worry is often rooted in fear and uncertainty, but it only robs us of our present joy. So, try to focus on these positive outcomes that you've just identified and slowly step away from the fear of potential losses.",
839,Discounting the positive,"My favorite food is steak, but anyone can order a steak how they like so maybe i'm not a real meat fan.","I used to think that steak was my favorite food, but lately, I've been wondering if I'm really a true meat fan since anyone can order a steak cooked to their liking.","It sounds like you're feeling unsure about your preferences due to what others might think or do. But remember, the fact that anyone can order a steak doesn't necessarily affect your personal liking or disliking for steak. It's your individual choice and preferences that matter. Could it be possible to separate your enjoyment of steak from other people's preferences?","You could be right, doctor. I think I've been overly concerned about the idea of just blending in with other people and not having a unique preference. I do enjoy steak, regardless of how others prefer their steak. I guess I just need to focus on what I like and other people's choices shouldn't affect that.","That's a great realization. Rather than questioning if you're a ""true"" meat fan based on others' choices, perhaps you could consider different angles. For instance, how do you feel when you're eating a steak? Does it bring you joy, satisfaction? Maybe even consider why you like steak. Is it about the taste, the texture, or something else? There may be something unique about your experience that sets your preference apart.","Yes, you're correct. When I think about it, I feel a sense of joy and satisfaction whenever I eat steak. I love the taste, the texture, and the whole experience of eating it. Perhaps I was too fixated on the thought that my preferences had to be unique to be valid. But, in truth, my experience of enjoying the steak is unique to me. I think I'm starting to see things differently now.","I'm really glad to hear that! It sounds like you've made a significant step towards understanding your own preferences, independent of anyone else's. It's essential to remember that the value or validity ofsee your point. Aging
