It's making me doubt my abilities as a writer and I'm starting to believe that I'm just not good enough.

Treatment step 1: Validate the patient's feelings and normalize the experience.
Psychologist: I can understand why you would feel disappointed about not doing well in the contest. It's perfectly normal to feel that way when we put a lot of effort into something and don't get the outcome we hoped for. It's also common for self-doubt to creep in during such times. Many writers face these challenges along their journey.

Treatment step 2: Challenge negative thoughts and offer perspective.
Psychologist: I want you to remember that the result of one contest doesn't define your entire worth as a writer. It's important to not let this one setback overshadow all your accomplishments and progress. Writing is a process, and even the most successful writers face rejection and criticism at times. It's an opportunity for growth and learning. I encourage you to not be too hard on yourself and to focus on what you love about writing.

Treatment step 3: Explore coping strategies and ways to improve.
Psychologist: Let's explore some coping strategies that can help you deal with the disappointment and self-doubt you're experiencing. Is there something specific about the contest results that you think could have been improved? Additionally, we can discuss techniques to strengthen your writing skills, such as seeking feedback and practicing regularly. Remember, improvement takes time and effort, but it's possible to overcome challenges and become a better writer.

Treatment step 4: Encourage self-compassion and positive self-talk.
Psychologist: It's important to be kind to yourself during this time. Negative self-talk can make it even harder to bounce back. Instead, try practicing self-compassion by acknowledging that setbacks are a natural part of any creative process. Remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments as a writer, and replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations. With time and persistence, you have the potential to achieve your writing goals.

Treatment step 5: Establish future goals and support systems.
Psychologist: As we conclude our session, I encourage you to set realistic goals for your writing journey. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART goals). It may also be helpful to seek support and connect with writing communities or groups where you can share your work and receive constructive feedback. Surrounding yourself with fellow writers can provide encouragement and help you overcome challenges together.

Remember, this setback does not define your worth as a writer, and you have the power to learn, grow, and achieve success in your writing endeavors.","  I understand that you're feeling disappointed about not doing well in the writing contest and it's making you doubt your abilities.

Sometimes an outside perspective can shed light on the issues and lead to a better understanding between both parties.
