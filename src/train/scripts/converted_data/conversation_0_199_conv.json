You are absolutely right, maintaining a professional relationship with your coworker could save both of you from potential uncomfortable situations at work. Finding activities outside the workplace will definitely help you diversify your focus and strengthen your emotional resilience. Regarding your concern about people talking behind your back, remember that such thoughts could merely be a projection of our own insecurities. Other people's conversations often have nothing to do with us. It's a significant step to challenge these thoughts with substantive evidence rather than assumptions. Carrying this newfound perspective forward will surely contribute to a more balanced view of your situations. Keep up the excellent work!"}]}

This indicates that they are thinking in extremes; either everyone is talking about them or no one is. This rigidity in thought leaves no room for the possibility that some friends might be discussing them, some might not be, or that the discussions might not necessarily be negative. This type of thinking is unrealistic and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.'}"}]}
